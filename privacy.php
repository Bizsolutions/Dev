<h3>Privacy Protection Policy</h3>

Note that the review that you shared will  be available for public consumption. When adding personal information on the  review, we advise you to practice it with extreme caution. This may include  your personal e-mail address. Most of our users prefer to leave their e-mail  address. This allows the companies to send them messages and discuss anything  related to their moving plan. Remember that our members are not obliged to  leave their e-mail address. In case you have any requests or concern on your  specific move, we encourage you to send us a personal e-mail message.

Based on the legislation, the company who shares  information of their customer to others thorough marketing purposes should  provide their customers with a method to obtain the important information of  entities that have an access to their personal details.
