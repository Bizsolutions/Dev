People love to call Cranford as their new home. Some people are drawn to the beauty of the place; others adore it for having a less-judgmental community. Your money will also go a long way here compared to the other towns in Bergen County. Here are other data and information that you should be aware of when <strong>relocating to Cranford, NJ</strong>.

Housing Market

The housing cost in Cranford is around the cost of the other cities in NJ. It is dominated by single family homes that are well-built. Moreover, the appreciation rate is at 5.48% which make it a good time to invest in real estate. However, stately places in Cranford are quite limited and pale in comparison to the state houses in Ridgewood and Westfield.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Essential-Tips-When-Youre-Moving-by-Yourself""><strong>A Good Place for Singles</strong></a>

The singles population of Cranford is continuously increasing. CNN named it as one of the best places that you should live if you are single. The singles account for more than 30% of the area’s population. CNN Money referred to this township as the ‘Venice of the State’. This is probably because of the Rahway River which flows through the town.

Transportation

Most people love the idea of <strong><em>relocating to Cranford, NJ</em></strong> since they have a convenient access to express bus and train station. However, remember that not every district will have access to its transportation system. Those who live in the Raritan Valley would have to transfer to Newark to ride their public transportation. In the near future, all districts will be getting a direct service and property value will be expected to rise up to 15%. The express busses have a direct stop at the train station which makes everything very efficient. By riding the bus, you will be able to reach Port Authority in less than an hour. Riding an express bus that will take you to NYC will take around 35 minutes under normal circumstances.

Nothing will catch you by surprise when <strong>moving to Cranford, NJ</strong>. If there is a bad side about the town, I would only think about the traffic. During the peak hours, the roads can be heavily flooded with vehicles. The residents are starting to tear down their small houses to build a bigger one.

Before you settle on a particular choice, you need to know some of the essential information about the country to make the transition process simple and efficient.

Australia

Australia is undoubtedly one of the top <strong><em>destinations for relocation</em></strong> for the expats and the retirees especially for the Brits and American citizens. A country that is culturally diverse and where some of the awe inspiring scenery can be found, it is no longer surprising why Australia made it on this list. This is also the place where some of the best beaches can be found. This country is a good place for a temporary relocation if you want to avoid the unforgiving winter season.

New Zealand

If you are <strong><em>moving abroad</em></strong>, you should consider New Zealand since it has some of the majestic natural scenery. While the living cost may not be as affordable as the nearby Asian cities, it is still the more reasonable option compared to the European cities such as London. New Zealand is known for its diverse and large cities but it also features a range of small towns that most expats are looking for.

United Arab Emirates

Cranes are gradually disappearing from the expansive skyline of United Arab Emirates. This place is indeed the top destination for young professionals who are looking for job opportunities. The place also offers extended financial benefits for those families who are willing to call this place as their new home. Nonetheless, we still recommend you to be familiar with the local regulations and laws before <strong>moving abroad</strong>.

Philippines

The country is currently the most affordable English-speaking nation which makes the transition process easier. Since the country is a major force in the outsourcing business, the American culture has been deeply ingrained on their system.

Proper moving requires a detailed logistical preparation, manpower, and years of experience in the business. When you <strong>hire movers</strong> to support you in your relocation, you can ensure that a great deal of stress and anxiety will be taken off.

Free Some of Your Time

You don’t have an unlimited amount of vacation to deal with the various aspects of the moving process. Most employees will prefer to spend their paid vacation during the actual moving day. No one has the time to pack and transport their items to their new community. This is why it is advisable to <strong><em>hire a moving company</em></strong>. They can address the time-consuming and challenging part of the moving task. By hiring them, the transition will also be much smoother.

Furthermore, you can use the free time in dealing with more important matters. When you are moving, don’t think that you only need to pack and transport your items in your new location. Some people also have to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Remodelling-tips-when-Selling-Your-Old-Home""><strong>stage their previous home</strong></a>, change their address, schedule the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Transferring-Your-Utilities-When-House-Moving""><strong>installation of utilities</strong></a>, and others.

However, this does not necessarily mean that they can transport your items without acquiring any damages.

Accidents can actually happen and the risk is a lot higher when you don’t <strong>hire movers</strong>. In case something unexpected happens and your items break, the money you save will go down the drain. With the help of the experts, all your items will be covered through their valuation. In case some of your items break or have been damaged, the company will provide you a reimbursement.

Finally, when you <strong>hire a moving company</strong>, you can guarantee that there will be nothing that will be left behind.

Know Your Options

Those who are moving on a college dorm should know that it would be an empty space. Most dorms will not automatically have the basic furniture such as mattress, bed, desk, dresser, or even a tiny lamp. You need to make sure that your space will be as lively and comfortable as possible since you are far away from your home.

This is the first step of the process and should also be on top of your <strong><em>moving checklist</em></strong>. You will need to find out the limitations on the airplane luggage. If possible, you also need to determine the cost of the extra luggage. This simply makes sense since it will help you decide whether it is wise to bring a particular item or not. Usually, it will be better for you to purchase cheap stuff such as towels rather than take them with you and pay for the extra luggage fee.

Organize them on a single folder and pack them inside the carry-on and not on the checked bags. If possible produce a photocopy of the documents and store the copy on a cloud environment. Ensure that your parents also have a copy of these important documents. This will enable them to send it to you during emergency situations. Here are some of those documents.

In this article we will discuss some of the things that you should know to make this experience more satisfying. If you want to make your life easier when <strong>moving in with parents</strong>, the tips and guide below can perhaps be of some assistance.

Establish an Exit Strategy

Before <strong><em>moving back with your parents</em></strong>, you will need to establish your exit strategy first. You should already have a specific goal or time that will tell you that it is time for you to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Time-to-Move-Out-of-Your-Parents-House""><strong>move out of your parent’s house</strong></a>. For instance, this is possibly just a temporary state until such time that you have already found a new job and save enough money that you can use for the deposit. For those who want to overcome their college debt, your debt-repayment plan should have a specific end period. This will be the time that you should be out of your debt which indicates that it is time to move out of your folk’s home.

Create Formal Agreement

When you are <strong><em>moving in with parents</em></strong>, even on the off chance that it is just temporary, it is advisable to set-up a proper agreement with them. It will be much better if this agreement will be put in writing. This will allow you to find a balance between living at your parent’s home and having a sense of independence. When creating an agreement, highlight any expenses that you are expected to contribute. Perhaps you will need to shoulder a fraction of your monthly bills, groceries, or the rental fee. Believe me, now that you are old enough, your parents will expect that you will help with the expenses while you are living with them. You may add some rules such as the time that you are expected to come home, keeping spaces neat and organized, etc.

Do Not Be a Freeloader

They may be your parents but it does not give you the right to be a freeloader. You should at least find a part-time job while you are still waiting for the call of the company where you applied. You should be able to contribute to the household expenses and monthly bills. Be committed in finding a job. Create specific goals. Set a specific time that you have to spend when searching for work.

Finally, you should be prepared to hear some of the judgment from them when <strong>moving back with your parents</strong>. You will be able to avoid these judgments by sharing your plan with them as well as your target date for your moving out.",,1/4/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/moving-back-with-your-parents/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1353972468_35db21dd03_b-jpg.jpeg,1353972468_35db21dd03_b-jpg,,,1353972468_35db21dd03_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,moving-back-with-your-parents,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

Determine the essential equipment that you may need to make this experience more satisfying. This will ensure you that your business will be open for transaction immediately once the relocation process has been completed.

The Packing and Moving Process

When you are working with the <strong><em>commercial moving companies</em></strong>, you will need to ask them the things that they can and can’t move. Most entrepreneurs will fail to take this into account since this is just a tiny detail. In case you are leasing a copier, the rental company will be responsible in moving the equipment. Take note that most companies that are leasing equipment will not allow other companies to move their equipment.

While you can hire the moving company to pack the office items, you will be able to reduce the cost by asking your employees to pack their personal items. This may include the items on their desks and inside their drawers such as snacks, coffee mugs, and photos. Make sure that everything is packed before the <strong>commercial moving companies</strong> move the desks, cabinets and office furniture. In case you are hiring the movers to pack your items, there are some things that you need to keep in mind. Remove all perishable items inside the refrigerator. Your garbage bins should all be empty. Monitors and computers should be wrapped separately for added protection.

In case you have cubicles, they will break it down first before preparing it for <strong><em>office moving</em></strong>. All furniture will also be disassembled and reassembled on your new office space.

If you are renting an office space, the timing will highly affect the success of your move.

disposing items| Ryan Crane| Scott Air Force Base

Moving requires a significant amount of time, money and energy. It does not make any sense to move the items that you will no longer need. Before <strong>hiring professional movers</strong>, you will need to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Decluterring-Before-Moving""><strong>sort your items and discard</strong></a> the things that we will mention on this list. Let us start enumerating them.

Items That Are Still in the Moving Box

Based on the report, the average US citizen will move at least 11 times during their lifetime. This means that you will have to pack and unpack all your items 11 times. There are instances when the moving days will be sooner than what you initially predicted. This may mean that you will not have enough <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Moving-Help:-Unpacking-Dos-and-Don%E2%80%99ts""><strong>time to unpack all your items</strong></a>. In case your item is still inside the moving box, this is an indication that you don’t need the items inside. We do not recommend you to just discard the entire moving box, instead, organize all the unopened moving boxes and find some time to go through all the items inside. Before opening the box, set a limitation on the items that you can take and stick with your rules. Items inside should be <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Sell,-Donate-or-Throw?-House-Moving-Tips""><strong>donated, sold, or discarded</strong></a>. Asking the <strong><em>professional mover</em></strong> to move them will just increase your expenses.

Outdated Items

Getting rid of the outdated item can be challenging but you need to do it. You will need to sort all your clothes and the clothes of the family members. Before <strong><em>hiring professional movers</em></strong>, put the clothes that you don’t wear in a single box. Clothes that are still in good condition should be donated. For your gardening and painting shirt, it is probably time to put them in your garbage bin particularly those clothes that have been severely worn out. This can also be used as a cleaning rag.

Expired Items

Expired medicines and food should be tossed in your trash can. Start by sorting all your canned goods. It is not safe to eat the foods that have reached their expiration date. In case the items are not yet expired but you won’t eat them anyway, consider adding them on your donation box. With regards to the expired medicines, do not just carelessly toss them in your trash can especially if these are pain killers. You should first crush it then mix them with the things that are inedible. Medications can also be flushed down the drain.

After you successfully discarded all the items that you don’t need, it is time for you to call the <strong>professional movers</strong>. You will be able to enjoy a more affordable moving rate now that you managed to get rid of the unnecessary items.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/toss-these-items-first-before-calling-the-professional-mover/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/120325-f-dh715-085-jpg.jpeg,120325-f-dh715-085-jpg,,,120325-F-DH715-085.JPG,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,toss-these-items-first-before-calling-the-professional-mover,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

You should not forget to create a knot on the trash bag to make sure that it is secured on your clothes. It would be better if you can secure it with packing tape.

Suitcase

Your suitcase is not just intended for travelling, you may also use this when moving to a new location. Rather than hauling an empty suitcase inside the moving truck, you may use them as a container when <strong>packing your closet</strong>. The sturdy material of your suitcase would be ideal to keep your valuable items protected. In addition, it comes with rollers that make it easier for you to transport heavy items. Start by stuffing the books at the base of your suitcase. Pants and jeans can also be packed inside the suitcase since they can be heavy when put together.

<ul>
 	<li>Markers- You should have at least two quality markers that you will use to label your containers.

 	<li>Labels- printable and ready-to-use labels can be purchased or downloaded online. Moving companies are also offering this supply.</li>
 	<li>Colored Tape- While you can use packing tape, your labeling system will be much more efficient with colored tape.</li>

Color Coding System

The best way to <strong><em>label moving boxes</em></strong> is through the use of the color coding system. The whole concept may be simple but it is really effective.

Numbering System

In case you find the color coding system a bit complex when <strong><em>labeling moving boxes</em></strong>, you should try the numbering system. For example, when you mark a cardboard box as ‘1’, this means that the items inside are highly essential. You may also add the tag ‘Kitchen1’ to indicate that this box contains all the important items in your kitchen and should immediately be arranged.

There are actually no stern rules when <strong>labeling moving boxes</strong>. Usually it all comes down to your own preference. However, there are guidelines that you should follow to make everything smooth and simple. In order to enjoy the best possible result, remember the guidelines that we mentioned above.

In order to remain on the good side of your neighbors, we provided some important <strong>moving tips</strong> that you should keep in mind.

Timing

By following this <strong><em>when moving</em></strong>, you can guarantee that the moving truck will have the necessary parking space. In addition, you can also ensure that you will not block the driveway that may impede the movement of the vehicles. Your activity and <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Tips-to-Move--Heavy-Furniture""><strong>moving large and heavy objects</strong></a> may also affect the daily activity of your neighbors.

Notify Your Neighbors on Your Impending Move

Your neighbors will probably be aware about your move. Nonetheless, you should also inform those people in your community that can be affected with your relocation. One of the essential <strong><em>moving tips</em></strong> is to drop them a simple card or note on their mailbox that indicates the date and the exact time of your move. Just like how they are unaware of your move, you may also not be aware about the family down the block that is planning to move during that day. Notifying them will help them coordinate with you on the parking of the vehicles and the moving truck. This thing is vital to the success of your move.

Secure Permission

<strong>When moving</strong>, you will have to determine the exact space where your truck is parking. On the off chance that the truck will be blocking the garage or driveway or if it can obstruct the access of others, you may need to secure the necessary permission. Most people will not mind the fact that you require the parking space. Nonetheless, if this results in their inability to go to work on time, the idea of being a good neighbor will dissipate. You should notify them ahead of time about the possible effect of your move.

With our years of experience in the business, we have learned a lot of things that will make the situation bearable. Apart from hiring the services of the <strong>cross country movers</strong>, there are tips that will assist you in navigating through this complex situation.

Avoid Lifting Things

When you are <strong><em>moving while pregnant</em></strong>, we highly discourage you from lifting the moving boxes. Your doctor may have already warned you against <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Proper-Lifting-Techniques-When-Moving-Heavy-Furniture-and-Boxes""><strong>lifting cumbersome and heavy objects</strong></a>. However, most of us ignore this warning since we normally feel like we are able to lift things. Understand that your muscle is in continuous strain during this period and you don’t want to aggravate the situation by adding weight. Those who will lift boxes will likely experience back pain and muscle spasm. Remain safe and allow the others to carry the heavy items.

Hiring Movers

Hiring the assistance of the <strong><em>cross country movers</em></strong> should be considered during this crucial period. Your decision to hire the professionals will greatly <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Important-Tips-to-Relieve-Those-Moving-Stress""><strong>reduce your stress</strong></a> and greatly improve your experience. Remember that your stress and anxiety will be bad for your baby. When choosing a professional mover, choose a company that is licensed and insured. You should ask them for their DOT number to verify that they are operating legally in your state. The best mover will make the relocation process organized and smooth.

Look for Obstetrician

Even on the off chance that you are not yet close to the due date, you need to ensure that you have a doctor in your next moving destination. You should make an appointment with your new doctors a few days after you move. This matter is a big decision, so make sure to explore all your options. Do not be pressured and feel like you are obliged to choose the first obstetrician that you will meet when <strong>moving while pregnant</strong>.

Pack in Advance

Packing is an exhausting process. If you want to make this easier, this service is being offered by <strong>cross country movers</strong>. However, if you want to do it on your own, be sure to start at least <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Things-You-Should-Do-8-Weeks-Prior-to-moving-Day""><strong>8 weeks before your moving day</strong></a>. Starting ahead of time will make sure that you will not overdo things. You will also be more ready during your moving day.

After the last box has been delivered to your home, our common instinct is to get all things unpacked at the soonest time possible. However, before you remove the packing tape from the moving box, remember these <strong>unpacking tips</strong> that will make your life easier.

Clean the New House

Regardless if you are renting the space or you purchased the house, it should be expected that the previous tenant or the landlord will leave the property clean. This is the common practice in the industry. However, their level of cleanliness may not pass your standard. Before you even rip the tape from the first box, you should first take a good look at all the corners of the house. In case it requires cleaning, you should do this before <strong><em>unpacking your house</em></strong>. Even on the off chance that it appears clean, it will not hurt to wipe the walls and vacuum the floor.

Start With Your Kitchen

After a stressful moving day, you will need to have a hearty meal to replenish your energy. While it is highly improbable that you will enjoy a gourmet dish during your first few days, you are still expected to eat to survive. You may need a few kitchen utensils and plates. You will also need to unpack the box that contains your microwave. One of the best <strong><em>unpacking tips</em></strong> is to open the boxes that contain the mugs and the coffee maker. This will enable you to enjoy your first breakfast on your new house.

Unpack Your Bedrooms

After setting up the essential items in your kitchen, you will have to open the boxes that contain the bedroom items. You will need to reassemble your bedroom first and throw a new comforter and bed sheet. After this stressful day, you will need a cozy place to rest. When <strong>unpacking your house</strong> especially the bedroom, make sure that every family member will do their part. You kids may need some small assistance, but they should still feel like they are involved.

Unpack Your Bathroom

After the bedroom, you will have to open the bathroom moving boxes. You will have to begin with the master bathroom. Start setting up your shower curtain. Stock up the items inside the medicine cabinet and vanity items. You should have a relaxing shower before retiring in the comfort of your bed.

The last moving box would be the items in your living room. Following these tips on <strong>unpacking your house</strong> will make everything convenient.

While moving out of state or out of the country will be challenging, it does not necessarily mean that it should be overwhelming. In order to minimize the stress that is often associated with relocation, you will need to develop a thorough plan. In this article we will discuss the common elements that should be included in your checklist according to the <strong>long distance movers</strong>.

The Items That You Should Be Moving

In case it was more than a few years since the last time that you move, it is highly possible that you accumulated a lot of things that you no longer need. Moving is an excellent time to get rid of these items. This should be started at the earliest time possible. When developing your <strong><em>moving checklist</em></strong>, specify the items that you are planning to move and the items that you are <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Sell,-Donate-or-Throw?-House-Moving-Tips""><strong>donating, selling or disposing</strong></a>. It is just too ridiculous to pay the movers for the items that you will not use.

The Packing Supplies

Most packing supplies can be purchased directly to your <strong><em>long distance movers</em></strong>. However, you should still specify in your checklist the number and types of items that you will need to make the process smooth. Start with <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Different-Types-of-Moving-Boxes""><strong>the moving boxes</strong></a>, shipping tape, and packing materials. You don’t want the packing process to stop simply because you are out of packing supplies. Be sure that you have enough to carry all the necessary items in your new house.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/A-Comprehensive-Guide-on-Moving-Perishables""><strong>Perishable Items</strong></a>

Examining your perishable items should be included in your <strong>moving checklist</strong>. Two weeks before your moving day, you should make use of all the items in your fridge and inventory. If you are planning to throw a farewell party, use your perishable ingredients and purchase only the items that you will need during the party. Perishable items will not only include the food, it also includes the bug sprays, paints, and cleaners.

Changing Your Address

The <strong>long distance movers</strong> also recommend you to change your address as soon as possible. Visit the companies whom you regularly conduct business and the local post office. You also need to inform your banks, credit companies, insurance companies, and brokerage on your change of address.

790,Getting an Accurate Moving Price,"In a process that is as complicated and expensive as relocation, getting an accurate <strong>moving price</strong> would be imperative. Moving is already a stressful process and you don’t want to be surprised on the cost that you need to settle. Your pre-planning strategy is the secret for a successful move. You need to pay careful attention to even the smallest detail. To make it simpler, you will have to plan your time, action and money to prevent this experience from turning into a complete nightmare.

Tips to Get an Accurate <strong>Moving Price</strong>

In case you are planning to hire the assistance of the professionals, they will provide you with a non-binding <strong>moving quote</strong>. The price may increase or decrease unpredictably. Usually, the final cost will be different from the estimate that they’ve given. In order to avoid these unpleasant surprises, you will need to exert sizable amount of effort.

Contact Several Companies

You should not immediately settle on the first company that you will encounter. You will need to have at least three choices. This will not only enable you to get an accurate <strong><em>moving price </em></strong>but also the best deal in the market. When discussing your project with the professional movers, it would be better if the venue of the meeting would be your house. According to the existing federal regulation, the company should have an office within 50 miles of your property. This will allow them to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Why-In-House-Assessment-is-Necessary""><strong>perform an in-house assessment</strong></a> that will help them calculate the price accurately.

Create a Checklist of the Items that You Will Move

Perhaps one of the mistakes that can result in additional charges on your <strong><em>moving quote</em></strong> would be the neglected appliances or room. Any items that the surveyors will not find in their list can affect the final price of your move and may affect the validity of your agreement. You probably thought that there are no items in your basement that needs to be moved. However, before you call the help of the surveyors, you need to develop a list of all your items. This inventory can assure you that no items will be missing after your move.

Non-Binding or Binding Estimate

When asking for the <strong>moving price</strong>, the surveyor will provide you with two types of estimation; the non-binding and binding estimates. The binding estimate means that you will have to settle the actual cost that is written on the contract. Nonetheless, you will need to be precise on the items that will be moved to ensure that the estimate will remain valid. Non-binding estimate on the contrary will be based on the special services and the total weight of your shipment. Be sure that you will ask the type of estimate that they provide before you affix your signature on the contract.

Finally, you should also examine the expiration date of your <strong>moving quote</strong>. Usually, the quote will be valid within a week. Your goal is to look for a quote that has 90-day validity. Upon receiving the quote, be sure to ask the moving company the time limitation to stay away from the surprising increase of your moving expenses.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/getting-an-accurate-moving-price/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10797544665_c5796b5f06_c-jpg.jpeg,10797544665_c5796b5f06_c-jpg,,,10797544665_c5796b5f06_c.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips>Moving Expense Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,getting-an-accurate-moving-price,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

While your parents will not stop you from <strong>moving in with your parents house</strong>, there are certain arrangements that will not work for them. You will have to set some practical expectations for those people involved before you even step through their door.

Establish Rules

Since you are <strong><em>moving back with your parents house</em></strong>, you should expect that the old rules in your house will still stay in effect. You will probably have a curfew hour. Curfews are not necessarily intended to restrict you; these are required to relieve their worries. Your parents will think that a terrible thing has already happened to you if you are still not home by 4:00am. Your parents on the other hand will need to agree and understand that invading your room without your permission and notice should never happen. Establishing the rules will make things clear for everyone.

Create a Time Frame

Of course, <strong><em>moving in with your parents house</em></strong> is just a temporary phase in your life. You are not planning to spend the rest of your adult life with your parents. You will need to create a particular time frame. How long do you plan to stay?

Money Talks

Talking about money matters can sometimes be awkward but you need to do it when <strong>moving back with your parents house</strong>. Talking to your parents about the amount of money that you need to share (either for food expenses, utility cost, rental fees, etc.) will ensure that you will stay away from lots of problems related with money.

Finally, you should also enjoy your time when <strong>moving in with your parents house</strong>. This is an opportunity for you to learn the recipe of your mom’s dishes and refine your fishing skills with your dad. This is a chance for you to reconnect with them after being away for so long.

The professional movers in the industry are following a standard guideline that allows them to deliver an excellent result. To help you separate the substandard companies to the top-notch movers, we have created a <strong>moving checklist</strong> that you should check out before you sign the agreement or contract.

Asking the company with the important questions will help you determine if they are a <strong><em>reputable moving company</em></strong>. The right movers should be able to provide you with the answers to your question without any hint of hesitation. Here are some of the questions that you should ask during the preliminary interview.
<ul>
 	<li>Do they abide on the standard of the moving industry?</li>
 	<li>Will they provide you a pamphlet that contains all their responsibilities and your rights as a consumer?</li>
 	<li>Are they insured? If yes, can they give you the number of their insurance policy and the name of the insurance company?</li>
 	<li>Will they use their own moving equipment or will they need to rent equipment? In case they are using subcontractors, ask the name of the company and their work history.</li>
 	<li>Can they provide you with references?</li>
</ul>
<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Estimated-Local-Moving-Costs""><strong>The Estimate</strong></a>

The estimate of the company (whether binding or non-binding) should also be included in your <strong>moving checklist</strong>.

</ul>
Never Assume

This may seem obvious but most of us can easily ignore this fact during a stressful event.

The substandard companies are always looking for ways to reduce their cost and failed to pay attention to the essential details. Avoid these companies at all costs.

With a little amount of planning, <strong>moving to temporary housing</strong> will be possible without too much stress. This will allow you to remain focused on the task ahead of you. Here are some of the basic steps that you need to take when packing your items.

Find Out the Things That Are Included in the Housing

Nonetheless, it will not contain the unique items that you will need to make your life comfortable. For instance, if you love cooking, you will need to prepare utensils that your company will not provide. Before you even start packing your items, ask your company for a list of items that are included in the apartment. This will ensure that you will not bring items that are already in the apartment.

Pack the Items that You Need

Your need will be different from the others. For those who are <strong><em>moving to temporary housing</em></strong> for company relocation, you will need to prepare items that are work-related, such as electronic <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/How-to-Pack-Your-Computer-for-a-Move""><strong>devices and computers</strong></a>.

Labeling Your Belongings

This will also prevent you from taking the items that you don’t own when the time comes to leave. Since you will likely mix the items that you own to the furniture and household goods provided by the company, you need to label the items that you own before packing it. This will help you differentiate your items. Any items that you will buy in the future should also be properly labeled.

When you are planning to move to <strong>temporary living arrangements</strong>, you need to create a checklist of the items that you want to take with you.

Whether the issue may be something insignificant as a parking space, you will have to let them know about it. Even in the event that you do not have the capacity to provide them with incentives, they should still be informed in advance that will help them decide for their future.

Options that will Help Them Adjust

All employees that are affected by this change will need to learn <strong><em>how to adjust in a new office</em></strong>. You can help them by presenting them with various options that will make their life easier. For instance, if their commute time will be significantly longer, consider giving them a flexible schedule. Allow them to have a better view on the new flow of traffic to let them understand the best solution for their new commute.

Inform Them about the Change in Parking

Apart from the changes that we mentioned above, there may also be changes in the parking system after the <strong>office relocation</strong>. Your employee should remain informed about the changes. You need to ask your employees about the things that they require. This will allow you to provide enough space for those who will need it. In case this is not a viable option, let them be aware of their other options. This will make them feel that you are concerned and that you are willing to provide support that will help them cope with the changes in your company.

Finally, you should keep your communication inside the company open. Efficient communication will guarantee that your <strong>office relocation</strong> will be a success. This is also a chance for the workers to ask the questions that have been bugging them. You should provide them with sufficient time to test if your new office location will perfectly work for their situation. Let them feel involved, give them a task and tell them the things that you expect from them when moving your business.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/how-to-help-your-workers-adjust-to-office-relocation/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/995405481_5744e1e486_b-jpg.jpeg,995405481_5744e1e486_b-jpg,,,995405481_5744e1e486_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips>Office Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,how-to-help-your-workers-adjust-to-office-relocation,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

Things to Consider| geralt| Pixabay

Before you make any decision to relocate your business, you will have to think about the advantages and drawbacks that it presents. In case your current office location is affecting the viability of the company, relocation will provide a multitude of benefits. Nonetheless, there are still <strong>things to consider in an office move</strong>. Here are some of them.

Reputation and Safety

When looking for a new base of your company, you should consider the safety of the place. In case the place has a higher crime rate and the neighborhood is not that friendly, finding and retaining the customers and employees will be challenging. Your old and loyal customers from your previous location will decrease due to this. Safety is one of the top <strong><em>factors that can affect corporate relocation</em></strong> and your company’s reputation. It has a negative impact on the image of your brand. Be sure that your customers and employees will not feel threatened in your new location.

Nearness to Your Targeted Market

Perhaps your new location will be situated close to your targeted customers. This means that this relocation will be advantageous for your business. On the contrary, if your target market is near your old business location, there is a possibility that your business will suffer. The proximity to your customers is one of the top <strong><em>things to consider in an office move</em></strong>. You should consult your existing clients to check if they are willing to travel to your new location in order to acquire your service or product. You should also ask them if communicating through email or phone would be a good option for them.

Competitors

One of the <strong>factors that can affect corporate relocation</strong> would be your rivals in the business. Before you transfer your business to a specific place, you need to know if there are any other companies who are providing the same product or service. The presence and credibility of your competitors may make it challenging for you to establish your company and survive the cruel competition. You need to make sure that there are not too many local competitions.

Finally, you should also think about the possibility that you may lose your top employees once you decided to relocate. There is a probability that they will look for other job opportunities close to their home. This is one of the <strong>factors that can affect corporate relocation</strong> that has a drastic impact on the state of your business. When moving your business, you want to retain your employees to reduce the cost of training new employees.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/factors-that-can-affect-corporate-relocation/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/judge-300554_960_720-jpg.jpeg,judge-300554_960_720-jpg,,,judge-300554_960_720.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,factors-that-can-affect-corporate-relocation,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

Moving, regardless if it is local or out of state, will involve a range of things that you need to consider. This includes the <strong>moving cost</strong>. On the off chance that you thought that the only expense that you have to incur would be the cost of hiring the service of the professional, think again. Oftentimes, this experience comes with unforeseen expenses. In this article, we will discuss some of them.

Auto Insurance

The profile of your auto insurance may change subsequent to the change of your address. Those who are moving from rural settings to an urban area should expect at least 15% increase on the insurance rates and this may increase up to 50%. For those who are going on a cross country move, they will be required to purchase extra coverage that will add to their <strong><em>moving expenses</em></strong>. Each of the state comes with their own minimum requirement. There are also states that will oblige you to carry motorist coverage and personal injury insurance. You should ask your insurance agent about the change on the rates and whether you will need to secure additional coverage.

Parking Fee

Apart from the increased cost in car insurance, your <strong><em>moving cost</em></strong> may also increase depending on the parking fee. Understand that the parking fee will not be included in the rental fee. A premium parking space can take as much as $300 in your monthly budget. Perhaps the best way to avoid the parking fee and the car insurance would be to discard your vehicle. The transportation system in the larger cities will be sufficient to take you to your destination at an opportune time.

Health Insurance

The <strong>moving expenses</strong> can be further increased with the health insurance. Not every insurance agency is licensed in all US states. Even if you are enrolled in an agency that is licensed by the 50 states, the type of health insurance and the cost will have to change. For instance, there are medical procedures or health services that are covered in a particular state but will not be covered in the other state. Unless your health insurance will be provided by your employer, it is highly possible that you will have to switch insurance companies.

Finally, your <strong>moving expenses</strong> can also be affected by the contract penalty, interest charges, overdraft fees, security deposit, late fees, and utility charges.

Lifting heavy objects| Ashley Gardner| Shaw Air Force Base

Before <strong>moving heavy objects</strong>, there are some things that you need to do to ensure that the process will be smooth. If you do not have the assistance of the professionals, be sure to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Friends-or-Professional-Movers:-Who-Should-Help-You-When-Moving""><strong>ask the help of your friends</strong></a> and family members. You should never tackle this humongous task on your own. Try to clear the path and be certain that there are no obstructions. You should also wear footwear with an anti-slip feature.

Thinking before Lifting

This is one of the first things that you have to consider before <strong><em>moving heavy furniture</em></strong> pieces. Your careless actions may result to various repercussions. While you have the temptation to prove yourself, you must resist this at all cost. Discuss it with your friends first and find the most suitable solution.

Increase Your Center of Gravity

Increasing your center of gravity will improve your body’s stability. Be sure to keep your feet in a wide position before <strong><em>moving heavy objects</em></strong>. Your left (or right) foot should be positioned slightly forward. By doing this, the weight of the item that you will lift will be evenly distributed. This will prevent you from placing a significant amount of pressure to a particular point in your body.

Maintain a Proper Posture

The inappropriate lifting will usually result to back pain or injury. This is something that you need to avoid at all costs. Always assume a proper back posture when <strong>moving heavy furniture</strong>. Your back should be in a straight line. Allow your lower limb to do the entire work to avoid any injury to your spine.

Bending Your Knees

In case you never moved a mirror before, understand that a small bump on the road can shatter this thing into millions of pieces. Fortunately, with some essential tips on storing and <strong>packing large mirrors</strong>, you will be prepared to tackle this overwhelming task.

Before you start on packing and <strong>storing mirrors</strong>, it is recommended to prepare the necessary supplies first. You don’t want to start and then stop at the middle of the process just because you need extra supplies to pack your mirror. You may need some tapes, bubble wrap, corner protectors, Styrofoam, and sturdy moving box.

Create an X Mark Using Masking Tape

Place your large mirror on a soft ground or surface such as your bed. Cautiously add strips of masking tape on your glass to create an ‘X’ Mark. This is a crucial step when <strong><em>packing large mirrors</em></strong> since it will prevent the mirror from shattering once you accidentally drop it. In case you dropped the glass at a considerable height, the masking tape will still protect the frame of the mirror. This way, you will only have to purchase the glass instead of buying the entire mirror.

Protect the Corners Using Corner Protectors

When <strong><em>storing mirrors</em></strong>, you will need to keep them safe from all possibilities. Normally, you will focus on the fragile part of the mirror and ignore the frame. This is a common mistake that beginners often commit. Remember that the frame of your mirror is the part that protects its glass. You need to protect the frames from the bumps using corner protectors. This is the ideal solution for mirror with right angle edge. You may also <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Ways-to-Reuse-Bubble-Wrap""><strong>wrap it with bubble wrap</strong></a> for extra protection.

Use Cardboard to Protect the Surface of the Glass

You will need a cardboard that you will place on the surface of the large mirror. Get your mirror and cut the cardboard to the appropriate size and shape. This will protect your mirror against grimes, dirt, and dust. When <strong>packing large mirrors</strong>, cardboards can also keep the glass safe from marks and scratches. You should also consider using Styrofoam that will minimize the impact on the glass. Place them on top of the cardboard and wrap them using a masking tape. Finally, cover it with a bubble wrap to guarantee that it will remain on its top condition once it reaches your new house.

Place it Inside the Box

When <strong>storing mirrors</strong>, you will need to prepare customized box that will keep them protected on their vulnerable areas. In case the box is too large, there would be enough space for the mirror to move which may lead to damage and breakage.

Finally, when <strong>packing large mirrors</strong>, you will need to label them properly. Add the label ‘fragile’ on all sides of the mirror including the bottom and the top of the box. This will allow the movers to handle your items with extreme care.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/storing-and-packing-large-mirrors/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/28160516629_9273c687df_b-jpg.jpeg,28160516629_9273c687df_b-jpg,,,28160516629_9273c687df_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips>Packing Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,storing-and-packing-large-mirrors,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

When you are preparing your items for moving, there are instances when packing the smallest objects will be the most challenging part. <strong>Packing lamps</strong> will be tricky due to the small moving parts and also the fact that they vary in terms of size and shape. Here is a step-by-step guide that will enable you to prepare your lamp for moving.

Prepare the Right Box

Usually, purchasing a moving box will not be an ideal solution. There are places where you can get <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Where-to-Find-Free-Moving-Boxes""><strong>free cardboard boxes</strong></a> that you can use for your move. Unfortunately, the boxes that you can avail at the local retail store will not have a standard size. During this situation, it would be recommended to purchase a box from your moving company. This will allow you to choose a box that is appropriate for the size and shape of your lamp. Before <strong><em>packing a lamp to move</em></strong>, measure the dimensions of your lamp to choose the right box.

Pack the Parts Separately

Before <strong><em>packing lamps</em></strong>, you will need to remove the lampshade and the bulbs. If you cannot detach the cord of the lamp, wrap it around the body of the lamp. You need to secure the cord so it will not disentangle. Using packing tape should be avoided since this can stick to the coating of your lamp and damage it. Wrap the lamp with <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Ways-to-Reuse-Bubble-Wrap""><strong>a bubble wrap</strong></a> before securing it with packing tape. You will need to cover it completely to ensure that it is protected.

Packing the Lamp Shade

When <strong>packing a lamp to move</strong>, it is recommended to use packing paper rather than the newspaper. It is not advisable to put other things aside from the packing paper and bubble wrap. Before removing the shades from your lamp, be sure that you have a clean hand to avoid staining. Pack this in a separate moving box. Be certain that they will be arranged conveniently.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Labelling-Moving-Boxes:-How-Important-is-Your-Marker""><strong>Labeling the Moving Box</strong></a>

To guarantee that the movers will handle the boxes carefully, you should mark the box with the tag ‘fragile’ after <strong>packing lamps</strong>. In case you have more lamps that you need to move, check if there is enough space inside the box. The labels should be added on all sides of the box.

879,Things You Should Know about the Moving Company Deposit,"When you are booking the service in advance (reserving for a restaurant table, hotel, or flight) the company will often require you to pay upfront to secure their service.

The cost should also be refundable in case you cancel their service at a specific time frame. Be sure to pay close attention to their payment policy before you make a choice.

Is This Required?

It may not be that uncommon to encounter a moving company who asks for deposit but there are also others who do not charge <strong><em>moving company deposit</em></strong>. Based on the law, the moving company is permitted to develop their own set of rules with regards to the payment terms and deposit. However, they are still obliged to disclose their rules.

Their services will require a great deal of time, effort, and resources. The deposit will serve as a compensation for their lost profit.

How Should I Know If the Deposit is Reasonable?

After you college life, you will need to settle with the increasing student loan and the entry-level salary. You will probably consider staying temporarily in your old home. This will help you save enough money that will help you prepare for the big battle of life. <strong>Moving out of your home</strong> will mean that you will have to shoulder the standard expenses.

Being Financially Stable

When you are planning to <strong><em>move out of your home</em></strong>, you will need to determine your monthly income first. In case you only have a temporary job, you might want to wait until such time that you have a stable job. You will then have to compute your average income. Add your income for the last 6 months and then divide it into 6 to get your average monthly income. The rental cost should cover the 28% of your monthly income. It would be better if you can find a property that is below this percentage. You should calculate your monthly expenses. This will include cable, utilities, phone, health insurance, internet, credit cards, and car loans. You should also figure out your expenses on food, gas, clothes, miscellaneous items, and entertainment. Once you factor all these things, consider if you can afford it.

Mature Enough

If you think you are mature enough then it is probably time to <strong>move out of your home</strong>. Start by discussing things with your parents. Your parents will need to prepare themselves to the fact that you are moving out. Your maturity will allow you to handle the complex matters that you may encounter when you are living independently. You should at least be able to manage your personal affairs.

Your Parents Are Dropping Hints

For those who are fortunate enough, their parents will leave some subtle signs that it is time to <strong>move out of your home</strong>. However, there are some instances when you will just discover that all your stuff is inside the moving box. In case they start to drop hints, you will need to seriously consider the idea of moving out. Do not wait for their request to change into a demand.

<strong><em>Moving out of your home</em></strong> will be easier to handle especially if you have someone who share your expenses. This is why you should consider <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Guide-on-Moving-with-a-roommate""><strong>looking for a roommate</strong></a> once you move out.

When you want to <strong>transfer utilities when moving</strong>, you need to deal with the task in advance preferably 2 weeks before your moving day. You will have to inform your service provider on disconnecting the service on your current location and transferring them on your next moving destination. Here are some things that you need to keep in mind.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/How-to-Be-Organized-When-Moving""><strong>Stay Organized</strong></a>

By the time that you decided that it is time for you to move, you should familiarize yourself on all the running utilities inside your house. Some of the most common utilities include electricity, water, gas, internet, cable, security system, satellite, phone, and garbage collection. When <strong><em>transferring utilities when you move</em></strong>, you should create a note that contains the name and the contact information of all your service providers. In the event that you are planning to switch, be sure to write the contact information of your new provider.

Notify Them At Least 2 Weeks in Advance

Once you organize all the names and contact information of your service provider, you will need to contact them and inform them about your decision to move. In case the utilities require you to book an appointment for the installation, it should be done at least 1 month prior to your moving day. If you <strong><em>transfer utilities when moving</em></strong>, the schedule for your connection should be two days before you move. On the contrary the disconnection should be two days after moving. This way, you can guarantee that the service will stay functional in case you will have to return to your old property.

Arrange for the Water Service

When it comes to sewer and water service, this matter will be handled by the new community. You may arrange this service to start by the time that you move to your new house. You should contact the local utility office a few weeks before you move to the community. In case your community comes with a HOA, the fee should cover the garbage collection, gas, sewer, and water utilities. This means that transferring utilities would be impossible with regards to these utilities.

Finally, you will need to update your address when you are <strong>transferring utilities when you move</strong>. Upon calling the service provider, inform them about your new address. This means that your monthly bill will be delivered to your new location.

1. Living is More Expensive

For the longest time, you have not been responsible in settling your expenses. You probably don’t care on how much you spend since you are not responsible in <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Planning-your-Moving-Budget""><strong>designing your house budget</strong></a>.

This is one of the very first <strong><em>things that you learn after moving out</em></strong>. Dealing with expenses can be a challenge during the first few months. In order to avoid overspending, you should get used to the idea of handling these expenses months before you move. Ask your parents if you can contribute to the household expenses months before your moving day.

2. The Concept of Freedom Can Be Scary

However, once you start doing it, you will realize that packing these sharp and pointy objects is never that easy. You need to make sure that it will not damage the other items inside the box.

After you have arranged all the knives, it is now time for you to decide how you wish to wrap them. All butter knives should be grouped together. The bread and steak knives (which include all the knives used for cutting vegetables and meat) should be in a separate group. Carving and chef knives are sharper and larger compared to the standard kitchen knives. It would be best to separate them from the rest of the knives.

Preparing the Packing Materials

When <strong><em>packing knives for moving</em></strong>, you will need to prepare the basic packing materials such as <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Ways-to-Reuse-Bubble-Wrap""><strong>bubble wrap</strong></a>, packing paper, and packing tape.

There should be at the very least 3 sets of packing paper for every set of knives. You will also need smaller boxes for your knives. An empty shoe box would be suitable for this situation. Smaller boxes will minimize the possibility that an accident may occur. Add some papers on the space of the box to serve as an extra cushioning material.

Packing Your Knives Safely

After completing the procedures above, you may now start <strong>packing up knives</strong> for moving. Start by laying packing papers (at least 3 layers) on the table. Place the knives on the packing paper. There should be around an inch of space between the knives. Starting on one edge of the packing paper, roll it until you completely wrap the kitchen knives. Secure it using a packing tape. Wrap it again with a bubble wrap that will serve as an extra layer of protection.

This is an important fact that you should be aware of since tunnels, bridges, and overpasses will normally have a low clearance.

General Rules on the Height Clearance of the <strong>Moving Truck</strong>

truck for rent| Joint Base San Antonio

According to the directive of the Department of Transportation (DOT), there should be a minimum height clearance of around 14ft-16ft with regards to the interstates and major roads. This means that you should never have to worry too much unless you have to take the road in the historical area and rural settings. In case the tunnels and bridges have a lower height clearance for the <strong>moving truck for rent</strong>, there should at least be a warning. Normally, you will see some signs that will tell you an alternate route and the best place to exit. In case you are unsure if you have clearance, it is not recommended to take a chance. You should immediately stop and figure out if the truck will perfectly fit.

Bridges Are Not the Only One with Height Clearance

It is not common that you will encounter a bridge with a low height clearance that will compel you to take action. This is especially true if you are going through a main road or interstate road. This is due to the fact that tunnels and bridges also come with height regulation. This regulation aims to prevent any problems associated with <strong><em>moving truck</em></strong>. However, there are also structures that are not regulated. This may include canopies at the gas station, parking garages, building awning, and ATM and bank drive thru.

The Clearance Height According to the Size of the Truck

Different size of the truck comes with varying clearance height. For instance the truck that measures 10-14 feet has a clearance height of 10ft. The larger <strong>moving truck for rent </strong>that has a size of 22-26ft has a clearance of 13 feet and 6 inches. This clearance is the maximum number of clearance for the given truck size. The actual height clearance can possibly be lower contingent upon the make and model of the vehicle.

Finally, you should refer to the stickers that are found in your <strong>moving truck</strong> to determine the actual height clearance. The number we provided above should only be used as a point of reference. There is a good chance that the accurate clearance is different from what we’ve stated. There are also other factors that can affect the clearance of your truck when moving. This includes the model and make of the truck, the Rental Company, and the size of the truck.

Rental companies will usually carry <strong>moving truck insurance</strong> that they can offer to their customers. This works similarly with the car rental. The two most popular types of insurance would be the insurance that covers your liability on the off chance that you caused property damage and physical injury and the one that covers any physical damage to the truck.

Do You Need to Purchase Insurance?

The decision will depend upon your needs and preferences. However, there are some factors that you should consider that may help you reach a better decision. Be sure to think about it when you are planning to buy <strong><em>insurance for rental truck</em></strong>.
<ul>
 	<li>Is it affordable- Of course, you need to check if buying insurance will fit your budget. Since you are moving on your own, you are probably <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Guide-on-Moving-on-a-Budget""><strong>moving on a budget</strong></a> and buying coverage can dramatically increase your expenses.</li>
 	<li>What is your experience in <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Essential-Tips-for-Driving-Moving-Truck""><strong>driving moving truck</strong></a>- Driving large vehicles is unlike your personal car. In case you do not have any experience in driving trucks, you will realize that it is more difficult to control.</li>
 	<li>Long Distance or Local Move- Purchasing <strong><em>moving truck insurance</em></strong> is recommended for those who are moving on a long distance. They are highly likely to encounter an accident compared to those who are moving locally.</li>
</ul>
Will This Cover Your Household Goods?

Most of the rental companies will provide you coverage on your household goods and personal items. Unfortunately, this type of coverage will only work for the damages that are sustained during catastrophe, accident or other similar situation while you are driving the truck.

However, if you are going on a long distance move, having an extra protection would be recommended. Even if you have to fly your items, you need to guarantee that you are appropriately covered.

A lot of people think that there is a specific formula to determine the accurate number of boxes that they need. However, that is not the case. You need to know that every house is unique that requires a custom moving solution. Nonetheless, there are still ways on how you can identify the <strong>estimate number of moving boxes</strong> you will need. You should comprehend the fundamental rules first.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Different-Types-of-Moving-Boxes""><strong>The Moving Boxes</strong></a>

When finding an answer to the question ‘<strong><em>How many moving boxes do I need’</em></strong>, you will need to understand the different types of cardboard. Once you buy these boxes, it won’t take long until you realized that there is a huge selection of materials available in the market. Different sizes and shapes are designed for various household items. However, you should not be overwhelmed on the significant amount of choices you have. Around 80% of the people who are relocating will only need the standard type of boxes; XL, L, M, and S.

Pay special attention to the medium and small moving boxes when you want to find out the <strong><em>estimate number of moving boxes</em></strong>. These are the boxes that you will usually need for the standard household goods. You should also identify the occupied space in your house in order to calculate the boxes that you will need.

Packing Calculator

Packing calculators of the professional movers would be a helpful tool in determining ‘<strong>how many moving boxes do I need</strong>’ if they can produce an accurate number. The issue on using the packing calculator is the fact that they create their estimate depending on the rooms in your house. As you probably know by now, room cannot be considered a measurement unit. In addition, there are no standard measurements that you can apply in every room. Rooms have varying sizes and shapes and the amount of items inside can also differ. This is why you can’t wholly rely on the packing calculator.

The easiest way to determine the <strong>estimate number of moving boxes</strong> would be to base it on the area of your house. For the houses that are below 700 sq ft, they will need at least 2 XL boxes, 4 large ones, 9 mediums, and 12 small boxes. The number increases as the area of the house increases. For instance, a house with an average area of 1,800 to 2,200 sq ft, they will need around 40 small ones, 39 medium boxes, 25 large, and 14 XL boxes. By following this guide, you will be able to determine the number of boxes that you will need.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/how-many-moving-boxes-do-i-need-2/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3873818998_1f67cda291_b-jpg.jpeg,3873818998_1f67cda291_b-jpg,,,3873818998_1f67cda291_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips>Packing Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,how-many-moving-boxes-do-i-need-2,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

Starting to Pack

It is not a secret that moving presents numerous logistical challenges. It is quite difficult to determine where and how you should start to <strong><em>pack and move</em></strong>. The first step is to prepare all your items for packing. Go through all your things and eliminate the items that you are not planning to take with you. You should prepare at least three boxes, one for the items to be donated, another for the items to be sold, and the other for the items that you need to discard.

Things You Should Know About Moving Boxes

Moving is synonymous to the pile of cardboard boxes. Your organization skills will start with these boxes.

971,Remodeling Tips when Selling Your Old Home,"Once you move into your new house, you will realize that <strong>selling your old home</strong> to cover the mortgage fee makes sense. However, you should remember that your home should be at its optimum condition before you list it on the market. Besides keeping it clean, you need to make sure that the landscape has been updated. Remodeling can help you increase the market value of your property.

With regards to <strong>selling your old house</strong>, remodeling may be an ideal solution but it also comes with a few drawbacks. If you fail to take these into account, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to recoup your investments. This means that it should only be ‘enough’ to receive the highest value for your house.

Taking Care of Our Investment

Before moving, we have to make sure that our investments (which include our property) were properly taken care of. This will not only help us increase its value but it will also enable us to mitigate the cost of repairs and maintenance. Having a scheduled maintenance will significantly decrease the remodeling expenses when <strong><em>selling your old home</em></strong> is your only option. The simplest task of maintaining the cleanliness of your gutter will help you stay away from water damages. Be sure to keep a record of all the maintenance that you will do since you may present it to your potential buyers.

Start With the Small Things

Before you decide to add a room in your house or install a fireplace, you need to remember that the small improvement can help you in <strong><em>selling your old house</em></strong>. For instance, our bathroom is perhaps our favorite place to renovate. Instead of introducing an expensive Jacuzzi, simply replacing the bath will make it more aesthetically pleasing. In addition, the improvement can cost at around $200 which will not affect your moving budget.

Avoid Going Too Far

While profound details on our house can indeed increase the value of our property, you should also not undermine the community value. In case the renovation that you introduced in your house is within the standard of the community, then it will help you recoup your investment. On the contrary, if your house look disconnected with the other properties within the community, finding the potential buyer would be a pain in the neck. Adding some features that will not match the house will be detrimental when it comes to <strong>selling your old home</strong>. Before you even start to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Home-Staging-after-Your-House-Relocation""><strong>remodel your house</strong></a>, be sure to walk around your neighborhood and be certain that you are sticking with the standard of the community.

These are just some of the helpful tips that you need to remember when renovating your house.

After the last moving box has been delivered in your home and the essential utilities have been installed, you still need to <strong>change your address when you move</strong>. You need to ensure that your letters, packages, and bills will be brought to your new address.

Updating Your Mailing Address

You should start by <strong><em>changing your address</em></strong> at the USPS (US Postal Service).This agency is keeping a record of all your past address. It will then automatically send all your mails to your new location. We cannot guarantee the effectiveness of this method, but the agency has its way to determine an outdated address. When you change your address through USPS, simply visit the official site of this agency. You will be charged at least $1 for the processing of your papers and verifying your identity. This means that you will need a debit or credit card to complete the process. For those who want to change it over the phone, you should call their toll free number 1-800-ASK-USPS. For those who don’t want to settle the verification fee, they can visit the office of the USPS.

Changing Your Billing Address

Your credit card company will never believe you, even on the off chance that the bill did not actually arrive. In order to guarantee that you will be receiving your bills, create a note on the bills that you are receiving. Contact each company and notify them to <strong><em>change</em></strong> <strong><em>your address when you move</em></strong>. Most companies will be willing to change your address to save time.

Changing Your Address on Subscriptions

Usually, <strong>changing your address</strong> with your magazine subscriptions can be completed online. Simply visit the official sites of the magazines and then input your customer number. Your customer number should be located either at the back of the magazines or at the inside of the latest issue. If you think this is a hassle, you can call the company and change the address through phone.

Driver’s License

In case you have to <strong>change your address when you move</strong>, you should also update your identification card and driver’s license. Usually, you should have around 30 days to update the information on your identification card. For those who failed to do this, they will have to incur hefty fines. Most of the states allow their residents to change it online. In case you can’t, you have to visit the office of the DMV.

Billing address should also be changed in case you are frequently buying items online and if you are a member of a club or organization. <strong>Changing your address</strong> will help you stay away from problems and ensure that you will receive all your letters, bills, and packages.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/moving-checklist-when-changing-your-address/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/download-jpg-1.jpeg,download-jpg,,,download.jpg,,,Checklist>Moving Checklist>After Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,moving-checklist-when-changing-your-address,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

<strong>Moving couch</strong> or furniture out of your old home will require lots of pushing and wiggling. There are also instances when you will be required to remove your door, especially if the furniture won’t fit. Determining if your couch would slip through the door is not that easy. Let us find out how you can make the process simpler.

Taking Measurement

Before <strong><em>moving a couch through a narrow doorway</em></strong>, you will have to take some measurements first. Start by measuring the accurate dimension of the couch. This will include the length, width, and height of the couch. You should also check if some of the parts are detachable. It would be wise to disassemble them first before taking the measurement. In case you can’t, the height of this furniture should be taken while the legs are attached. Take the measurement of the height by starting on the floor to the top of the couch.

Apart from the couch, you will also need to take measurements of the doorways where the couch will go through. When <strong><em>moving couch</em></strong>, you will pass through several doors, narrow stairs or perhaps an elevator. You will need to determine if the given space will be suitable for your furniture piece. When determining how narrow the space is, you need to measure both height and width. Apart from that, you should also make sure that there will be enough <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Moving-Tips:-How-to-Use-the-Extra-Space-of-Your-New-Home""><strong>space in your new house.</strong></a>

The Back of the Couch Is Sometimes Higher

In the event that the height of the couch back is higher, then the width should be narrower when compared to the width of your door. For instance, if the width of the door is around 40” while the height of the couch is at 38” and the width is 43”, simply turn it back when <strong>moving a couch through a narrow doorway</strong>.

For High and Wide Couch

There are also situations when the width and height of the couch is beyond the size of outdoor space. This time, you will have to look at the length of your couch. Simply measure the length of the couch and the height of your door. Under a favorable situation, the couch length should be lower than the height of our door. There should also be enough room to maneuver when <strong>moving couch</strong>.

In case you’ve done everything and it still won’t fit, consider removing the feet of your couch. You may also hire the service of professional movers who can provide you with different options on <strong>moving a couch through a narrow doorway</strong>.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/moving-a-couch-through-a-narrow-doorway/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/couch-576132_960_720-png.png,couch-576132_960_720-png,,,couch-576132_960_720.png,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,moving-a-couch-through-a-narrow-doorway,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

In case you are moving to a new house, no one wants to spend their first day in their new house without water and electricity. You need to create a comprehensive plan that will guarantee that your utilities are up and running before you move in. Here are some tips to help you <strong>set up your utilities</strong>.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Finding-the-Best-Utility-Service-Provider-when-Moving""><strong>Determining Your New Provider</strong></a>

Contingent upon your next <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Popular-Destination-for--Relocation""><strong>moving destination</strong></a>, there is a possibility that your current service provider is not operating in your new community. Probably you are <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Ultimate-Guide-When-Moving-Out-of-State""><strong>moving out of state</strong></a> or in another country where different regulations apply. The process of <strong><em>setting up utilities for a new house </em></strong>may also be different. Be sure to visit the official site of the state or the city that will give comprehensive information for the fresh transients. This will include the name and the contact information of the utility companies. Perhaps the easiest way to gather information about the service provider is to Google them. Almost all cities will provide services such as recycling center, water and sewer service, and garbage collection. The state, on the other hand, will provide the energy options.

When to Call the Utility Companies

In order to guarantee that your utilities will be functional by the time that you move in, it is recommended to call them at least 2 weeks before your moving day. While there are companies that can complete your request within 3-5 business days, there are others that will require about 10 days to <strong><em>set up your utilities</em></strong>. This situation will not be uncommon during the peak season. Consequently, the utility companies should also be notified 2 weeks in advance for disconnecting the utilities in your previous home. This means that before you call the moving company, you should decide on the exact date that you are planning to move in. When calling them, it is important to confirm how long it will take them to complete the job.

How to Apply?

The process and the policy of each utility company vary with regards to <strong>setting up utilities for a new house</strong>.

After unplugging your fridge, you will need to protect the cord by rolling it up and taping the cord to the fridge. This will prevent the cord from tangling. The screws that were removed from the fridge should be placed in a zip lock bag. If you want to know <strong><em>how to move your refrigerator</em></strong> safely, cover it with blankets that will protect it from scratch.

3. Take Measurement

You will need to measure the width and height of your fridge and your doorways to ensure that the unit will perfectly pass through. In certain situations, you will be compelled to remove your door and the door of the fridge in order for it to fit. Prepare a measuring tape along with your notepad. You don’t want to prepare an appliance dolly when <strong>moving refrigerator</strong> only to find out that it will not fit through.

4. Use Dolly

Most of the fridges that are sold in the market today come with a wheel. This means that sliding it should not be too much of a hassle. In case you want to know <strong>how to move your refrigerator</strong> using dolly, tilt the fridge forward first before you slip the furniture slider. Stand in front of the unit and then slowly guide it to the right position.

Contingent upon the area where you are planning to move, you will realize that renting an apartment can be more expensive than what you originally expected. You also probably found out that your current salary will not be sufficient to cover the rental cost. Whatever your case may be, it is very important to create <strong>budget for apartment</strong> before you sign the lease agreement.

How to Determine the Right Budget

Before you start creating a budget, you should have a specific amount in place. This will make it easier for you to calculate your monthly expenses. In case you still don’t have an existing budget, this is a perfect opportunity to do so. Start by figuring out your monthly expenses. This will include learning <strong><em>how much does it cost to move to a new apartment</em></strong>. You should then determine your monthly average salary. To do this, you need to add your salary for 6 months and then divide it by six. Subtract all your expenses to the monthly income and you will be able to determine the amount of money that will be left behind.

Expenses That You Need to Take into Account

When you create a budget<strong><em> for apartment</em></strong>, the monthly rental cost will not be the only expense that you need to settle. You will also need to shoulder the monthly utility bill such as the cable, water, electricity, gas, security, etc. You will also need to consider the renter insurance. Estimating these expenses should never be difficult. In some apartment, they may offer you to pay a flat rate for the internet and cable. This minimizes the need to deal with multiple companies. Other expenses that you will need to take care include the administration fee, storage cost, parking, garbage pick-up, pest control, and pet fees.

Identify How Much You Can Afford

Before you know <strong>how much does it cost to move to a new apartment</strong>, you will first need to learn how much you can afford. With proper budgeting and planning, you will be able to deal with all these expenses. Start with the one-time fees and you will realize that the rent will be more affordable as time passed by. In order to determine if you can afford it or not, the basic rule is that your current income should cover 3 months of the rental cost. This means that if the rental cost is around $1,000, then your monthly income needs to be at $3,000.

lease agreement| Rental realities| Flickr

It is essential that you understand your lease including the stipulations that are related to moving. All lease agreement will include a clause that pertains to the release. This section will also highlight your responsibility. Some of the responsibilities will include the weeks that you have to notify the property managers or landlords, penalties when you <strong>get out of lease</strong> and the condition of the apartment when you leave. In most cases, it will require you to notify the landlords 30 days prior to your moving day while some of them can request as much as 60 days.

Be Aware on the Rental Laws

On the off chance that your lease agreement does not include the ‘release’ clause, you should refer to the local laws with regards to the tenant notification before your moving day. Normally, it should be 30 days if it is not highlighted in the agreement. The local laws will also specify if <strong><em>getting out of the lease before moving in</em></strong> is allowed. Under this condition, you will be able to terminate the lease agreement without incurring any penalties. There are also some conditions when you can break out of the lease without settling penalties such as reasons that are instigated by the landlord and structural damage. Be sure to check the local laws before you take action.

Understand the Related Penalties

In most cases, the penalty will be equivalent to your three months rental cost. If you live in a major city, this can be costly. Be aware of the expenses before you decide to <strong><em>get out of the lease</em></strong>. If you are planning to rent another property, you need to remember that you will have to present a reference from your previous landlord. Unless this is done amicably, you will find it more difficult to find a rental property. Usually, settling the penalty fee is the easiest way to break the lease. Though you will have to pay a hefty cost, you can guarantee that your credit rating will remain intact.

Is Subletting an Option

There are rental properties that allow subletting while others are not open to this. As we mentioned above, you need to check your lease agreement to find out if this is allowed. In case subletting is allowed, be sure to consider this option. It can be a time-consuming and arduous process but it can also save you some cash. In case it does not allow subletting, you need to negotiate with your landlord to get their approval.

Finally, when <strong>getting out of the lease before moving in</strong>, you should inform your landlord in advance. In case you maintained a good relationship with them, you will find this process rather easy. This will translate to a better moving experience.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/getting-out-of-the-lease-before-moving-in/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/13059257905_145ac1bfe9_b-jpg.jpeg,13059257905_145ac1bfe9_b-jpg,,,13059257905_145ac1bfe9_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,getting-out-of-the-lease-before-moving-in,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

Checklist When <strong>Moving to Mexico</strong>

Your plan to<strong> move to Mexico</strong> should start 3 months in advance. This is due to the many complex factors that may arise. This guide is intended to give you a complete list of the items that you need to prepare. Be sure that you have all of these.

Travel Documents

Check if all the members of the family are carrying the necessary travel documents when <strong>moving to Mexico</strong>. This may include VISA and passport. In case you are moving for company relocation, the employer should take care of these documentations. On the contrary, if you are retiring or independently relocating, then you will be responsible in taking care of these. Be certain that you will complete the process required for living/working in the country. The passport that you are carrying needs to be valid for at least a year before you apply for residency. In case they will expire soon, you need to renew your VISA before you submit them to the consulate office.

Driving Licenses

Mexico will not necessarily require you to carry an International license. This means that you can simply take your license to drive in the country. Once you <strong>move to Mexico</strong>, you can then apply for a driving license that will allow you to drive legally on various states. For instance, if Mexico City is <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Popular-Destination-for--Relocation""><strong>your next moving destination</strong></a>, you can simply fill up the form and present your VISA and pay the accurate fees. Your driving license will then be issued after this.

Electrical Appliances

It is only expected that you will take your electrical appliances with you when <strong>moving to Mexico</strong>. The electronic gadgets that are functioning under a low voltage will work suitably in the country. In case you originally live in America, the voltage will relatively be the same. However, for those who reside in Europe, you will have to leave your electrical appliances behind.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/A-Comprehensive-Moving-Guide-on-Pet-Move""><strong>Taking Your Pets</strong></a>

Regular pets such as dogs and cats can be transported to this country. Nonetheless, you will still need to secure the necessary permits. Your pet should also be vaccinated and complete with all the important papers. A Health Certificate will also be needed. It should be supplied by an authorized veterinarian. When you want the other pets to <strong>move to Mexico</strong> such as ferrets, snakes, rabbits, and birds, you will need to secure an import permit.

Start creating your packing list, develop an <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Steps-To-Create-Home-Inventory""><strong>inventory of your items</strong></a> and decide which room you will start with your packing task.

Do Not Hesitate to Ask for Help

When you are <strong><em>packing at the last minute</em></strong>, you should not be afraid to ask for help since this will not be a simple task. Ask your family members and friends to assist you. Most of them will be happy to help you in exchange for laughter and a box of pizza. Prepare some refreshments to show how you appreciate the help of your friends. In case they are not available, do not easily judge them. You should inform them at least a month before packing your items. You can also <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Why-Do-You-Need-to-Hire-a-Professional-Organizer-When-Relocating-Houses?""><strong>hire the service of the professionals</strong></a> to make the process smooth and painless.

Prepare the Supplies

You should not depend on the used moving boxes that are lying around your house especially during <strong><em>last minute packing</em></strong>. You will need sturdy boxes that can carry the weight of your items and will not break even when exposed on high amount of pressure. Prepare all the packing material before you start with the task. This will include <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Ways-to-Reuse-Bubble-Wrap""><strong>bubble wrap</strong></a>, plastic wrap, packing tape, packing paper, etc. Running out of supplies while in the middle of the task can reduce your time that should be intended wholly for packing.

Avoid Packing Everything

When <strong>packing at the last minute</strong>, it can be tempting to just throw all your items inside the box. However, you must resist this at all costs. There is just no point in packing the things that you will no longer need. In case you don’t have the time to sort your items to separate the things that <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Sell,-Donate-or-Throw?-House-Moving-Tips""><strong>you can sell or donate</strong></a>, you don’t have to feel bad about this. Simply place the things that you don’t need or those that won’t fit in another box. If you don’t wish to discard it, you can place it temporarily on a storage unit. Most moving companies are providing this added service.

You should manage your time wisely when <strong>packing at the last minute</strong>. If you find yourself unable to complete the packing task, be sure to seek the help of the experts.

When <strong>moving to another city</strong>, you should start with your job hunt before you even relocate to the place physically. For those who need to move abruptly to a new place, some of the tips that we will mention below will support you in developing a network and looking for a job to ultimately gain financial stability.

Check Out the State of the Local Market

In case you are not eyeing for a certain company, you need to determine the major employers in the market. You may do this by reading the business paper. When <strong><em>moving to a new city without a job</em></strong>, you need to find out which companies are currently in the news. This will give you a better idea on the state of the market. After you managed to identify the top 10 local companies, be sure to gather enough information about each company. Check for their annual report in case it is available. Visit their official site to get an overview of their company.

Start Networking

Once you decide that you need to move, you will need to begin building your network. It is recommended to create a connection with the professional organizations when <strong><em>moving to another city</em></strong>. There are also regional groups in the industry that will support you in growing your circle. For those who can afford it, you might want to take trips in your <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Popular-Destination-for--Relocation""><strong>next moving destination</strong></a> before the big day. You should also join networking events.

Part-Time Jobs

When <strong>moving to a new city without a job</strong>, you should not necessarily ignore the power of getting a part-time job. While it is our ultimate goal to get a full-time job, having a part time job can still temporarily support us financially. Apart from that, it is also the best way to gain the necessary experience and exposure. This is also a unique opportunity to gain new skills that you can present to your future employers.

Most of the employers will prefer to hire local candidates in order to save a great deal of cash in relocating their workers. For those who are <strong>moving to a new city without a job</strong>, this may not be a disadvantage. Explaining the reason behind your move will make the company realize that you are not a ‘flight risk’. This may convince the company that you are the perfect person to handle the job.

Talking Head| GoodFreePhotos

Business owners would have to remain honest with their workers. Once they considered that <strong>company relocation</strong> is the best option for their business, they will need to inform their workers immediately. This will allow the employees to consider all their options. Here are some of the skills that the manager should master when it comes to communicating with their workforce.

Setting the Context

All of your employees joined your company due to a different context. It can be the result of the mixture of experiences, memories, culture, and upbringing. It is the responsibility of the business owners or managers to establish a shared vision with their employees. If you want to know <strong><em>how a manager should talk to employees</em></strong> when moving, you should be able to give them a clear picture of this experience. This will help them understand how they fit in with this change.

The Art of Repeating

Perhaps one of the most common mistakes when communicating about the <strong><em>company relocation</em></strong> is that you often think that communicating is just a one-time affair. You will think that sending them an e-mail once a while will be sufficient. According to the research, one needs to hear information a couple of times before they understand it. Communicating the vital messages to your employee repeatedly is a good way to build credibility and trust. You need to stay consistent when touching all the crucial points of your move.

Check their Understanding

Learning how a manager should talk to employee will also require you to know if the employees comprehend your message. Communication is not just about relaying the message; it is ensuring that the person receiving the message understands it. In order to guarantee that they understand the message, you will need to pose some useful questions. Ask them the opportunities and possibilities that they see from this move. You may also ask them to repeat the main idea of the message that you just shared with them.

Listen

During <strong>company relocation</strong>, you should learn how to listen to the input of your employees. This will allow you to look at things in a different perspective and find a solution that you haven’t thought of. This will help you understand the type of environment that your workers prefer and the reason behind their engagement and motivation. This is also an opportunity to show how much you appreciate your workforce.

Learning <strong>how a manager should talk to employees</strong> when moving will help you convey the actions that you are planning to drive.

When you want to <strong>move without bringing bed bugs</strong>, it would be wise to use plastic containers that come with lids that can be completely sealed.

Boxes that you collected from various sources such as local grocery stores and restaurants may be infested with bugs. This is why we normally recommend plastic containers.

Checking the Appliances and Electronics

In case you are experiencing a full-blown pest infestation, then it may be necessary to discard the old electronic appliances. Some of the small appliances that are possible hiding ground of bugs would be alarm clocks and coffee pots. Compared to the other habitat of the bugs, you can’t really completely get rid of the bugs using the commercially-available treatment products.

Be sure to keep them inside this bag until such time that you need to unpack them. You should analyze them before taking them out of this plastic bag.

Kitchen Items

Our kitchen, due to the high presence of moisture and food, is a perfect thriving ground for pests. If you like to <strong><em>move without bringing bed bugs</em></strong>, start by washing all your utensils. Allow them to dry before packing them immediately. You should also check your perishable items in your kitchen. It is time to discard all the possible items that may carry bugs. Dry goods can be a possible carrier of bugs. To make sure that your perishable items do not contain any bugs, you should place them inside the freezer overnight (including grains and rice) to kill the larva of the bugs.

Plants

There are instances when you will have to move plants but before that, make sure that you will check if there are things moving on the dirt of the plant. Look under the leaves and stems. In case you are not sure about it, it would be best to leave this thing behind. Plants are sensitive and there is a low possibility that they will survive once they are introduced to a new environment.

Before you relocate in an unfamiliar territory, you need to pay attention to the list of <strong>things to consider when moving</strong>. We listed some of the questions that you need to ponder about that will help you identify if this is the best option for you.

Can I Afford it?

This may seem basic but due to the excitement that we feel, we can easily forget about the financial costs that are related with our move. Consider the total amount of your existing debt before you even think about relocating. Your student loan, mortgage, and credit payment should not exceed beyond the 36% of your current income. You should be able to set aside some cash that you can use during an emergency situation. There are also some <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Unforeseen-Moving-Expenses""><strong>unforeseen expenses</strong></a> related with your move that you will need to settle. This is definitely one of the <strong><em>questions to ask yourself when moving</em></strong>.

Do I Have Any Friends In My <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Popular-Destination-for--Relocation""><strong>Next Moving Destination?</strong></a>

One of the <strong><em>things to consider when moving </em></strong>would be your friends. After you graduate, it can be quite difficult to establish your social circle, especially when you are relocating to a new territory. Knowing at least one person in your new place will help you build your social footing. If you don’t know anyone, this will be an isolating and lonely experience. In case you feel depressed on the idea of leaving your friends in your current location, this is probably not the ideal time for you to move.

What Is The State of the Local Job Market?

In case it is your dream to live in a large city, then pack your bags and leave. However, if you still don’t have a work that falls within your line of profession, you should at least have an offer from a company before moving to the city. This is one of the most important <strong>questions to ask yourself when moving</strong>. If possible, you should file a request for your company to relocate you. You should also determine the per capita income and the median household income of the state. Do not forget to check the current unemployment rate of the city.

While moving is often filled with logistical challenge, it can also be an experience filled with adventure. This is why you need to remind yourself about the <strong>questions to ask yourself when moving</strong>. Living in new cities will not only open you to new life opportunities, it can also help you establish new relationship. This is a chance for you to evolve and grow.

This event will highlight the unique personalities of your kids. This is an opportunity for the parents to learn more things about their children. If you think that they are having trouble adjusting, here are some things that you can do as a parent.</p>
<p>Educate them About the Positive and Negative Aspects of Moving</p>
<p>Some experts will advise you to just inform them about the positive sides of <strong><em>moving to a new community</em></strong> to keep their anticipation and excitement high. Nevertheless, there will come a time that your kids will understand the negative part of this. You should inform them about the negative and positive things that will help them manage their expectations. Once the kids were introduced to the new place, they will become strangers. They will have to learn new social rules that they may not be familiar with. No matter how hard it will be, tell them that you will always be there in case things become too overwhelming.</p>
<p>While you should inform them about the negative aspects, you should place an emphasis on the positive things that they may experience when <strong><em>moving to a new city</em></strong>. Tell them that it is a unique opportunity for them to learn something new. They may find it interesting to learn the new culture and interact with new people. Inform them that this move will be beneficial for the entire family.</p>
<p>Allow Them to Express Their Emotions</p>
<p>Be sure that you will notify your kids even if you are just considering the idea of <strong>moving to a new city</strong>. This will give them enough time to prepare themselves for the changes that await them. A year ahead of the moving day would be appropriate. Let them know that you understand their sadness that comes from leaving the place they are familiar with and their friends. Be sympathetic and advise them that it is just normal to be nervous about it. You should also be honest with them if you feel apprehensive and nervous about this move.</p>
<p>If you want them to quickly adapt to their new situation, you should take them on a quick trip to the new city and school before you move. They will eventually understand that there is really nothing different with their new place. <strong>Moving to a new community</strong> can be nerve wracking to children but with the right support, they can adapt well with their new surroundings.</p>",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/how-to-support-your-kids-in-moving-to-a-new-community/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/diverse-kids-1488994758ax3-jpg.jpeg,diverse-kids-1488994758ax3-jpg,,,diverse-kids-1488994758Ax3.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,how-to-support-your-kids-in-moving-to-a-new-community,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020

There are some things that you need to bring with you during the <strong>college move-in day</strong> that will make the transition a lot simpler. We’ve highlighted some of those items that will help you get through this emotional and intense period.

Dolly or Foldable Cart

The universities and colleges will usually provide carts to their students during the <strong><em>college move in day</em></strong>. This is as long as they present a valid ID. If you don’t want to wait in line, you should bring your own dolly or foldable cart. This will allow you to start carrying your items in your own dorm before the elevator becomes crowded. In case the college dorm does not have elevators, your items should be organized inside the plastic bin. This will make it easier for you to transport your items on narrow stairs.

Power Cords

You should not forget the chargers of your electronic equipment during the <strong><em>college move-in day</em></strong>. Your phones and laptops will be virtually impossible to forget but it is relatively easy for us to ignore their power cords that will make them functional. You also need to ensure that you have an internet connection. Bring an Ethernet cable with you just to make sure. The Ethernet cable should be at least 15 feet in length. Those who have wireless connection can totally forget about this.

Office Supplies

You also need to pack some office supplies such as pencils, pens, highlighters, staples, and staplers during the <strong>college move in day</strong>. Even on the off chance that most of your school assignment will be done using a PC and laptop, this will still be helpful. Regardless if you are computing the derivatives in your calculus class or you are creating literary piece for your British literature, office supplies will be handy.

First Aid Kit

Your college life will not make you invincible. Preparing your own first aid kit will help you avoid a random visit to your college health facility. Be sure to take your time when gathering the items that you will add in your kit. Make sure that you will bring thermometer, cough drops, ibuprofen, ice packs, and adhesive bandages at the very least. This kit will help you during times of emergency so be sure to bring them during <strong>college move-in day</strong>.

The <strong>college move in day</strong> will be over in a rush and you need to remain enthusiastic about the things that await you.

There are <strong>common packing mistakes</strong> that are completely inevitable. You will have to be fully-prepared to guarantee that the transition will be easy and smooth. We also added some tips that will help you avoid them.

Moving without a Packing Plan

One of the usual <strong><em>packing mistakes to avoid</em></strong> is to pack your stuff without any plan. You should not start <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Guide-on-Packing-Your-Personal-Item""><strong>packing your household items</strong></a> without any clear method. Although it might be tempting to throw all your stuff inside <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Different-Types-of-Moving-Boxes""><strong>the moving box</strong></a>, you will have to resist this at all costs. You will initially think that it will save you time but you will struggle when it is time for you to organize your items. Finding the items you need is going to be a challenge. In addition, the probability that your personal items will be damaged is high.

Not Sorting the Items

Most of us will simply pack all the items we own and we will only sort them once we arrive in our new home. This is one of the <strong><em>common packing mistakes</em></strong> that can easily be avoided. This will just waste the space inside the moving box. In addition, there is no point in taking items that you are planning to discard. Remember that most moving companies will calculate your moving expenses based on weight or the time needed to complete the task. The fewer the items that you need to transport, the lesser the cost will be.

Insufficient Packing Supplies

Packing supplies are expensive, which is why we will normally advise you to <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Where-to-Find-Free-Moving-Boxes""><strong>find free moving boxes</strong></a>.

Having insufficient supplies is one of the <strong>packing mistakes to avoid</strong>.

Overfilling Moving Boxes

One of the <strong>common packing mistakes</strong> that you can commit is to overstuff your boxes with your personal items. While you can indeed save a lot of space, there are lots of problems that can arise from this method. Aside from the fact that it will be difficult to lift them, the items inside can also be damaged.

In case you are looking for a new company, there are some attributes that will tell you that they are the best company for your situation.

The idea that you need to <strong>switch service provider</strong> can be a bit confusing and can sometimes be intimidating. Hopefully, by providing you with the things that you need to consider when looking for the best company, you will be able to simplify the entire process.

Reputation

There are virtually thousands of choices when it comes to <strong><em>utility service provider</em></strong>. Choosing the best one according to your needs and situation can be overwhelming. The process will become more confusing once you realize that there are some companies who are doing misleading marketing techniques. They will initially offer you the lowest monthly rate that will gradually increase after only a couple of months. There are also others that will charge you with <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/The-Hidden-Moving-Expenses""><strong>hidden fees</strong></a> that are not originally stated in their marketing. Since the deregulation law is relatively new, there are shady companies who are taking advantage of this. Be sure that you will highly consider the reputation of the company before choosing them. You should read online reviews and feedbacks from their existing consumers.

Rates

Once you <strong><em>switch service provider</em></strong>, you will have to think about if you want a fixed or a variable rate. The same thing can be said for the water, internet, heat, and other utility services. Most of them will offer fixed and variable cost. The fixed rate will compel you to pay the same cost/kwh during the entire duration of your contract for the energy. The variable cost will change depending on the month. Those who will choose the fixed rate can easily predict their expenses while those who choose the variable could pay more or less than their expected rate.

Length of the Contract

When looking for <strong>utility service provider</strong>, you will also have the option to choose the company according to the length of the contract. Regardless if you are looking for a short-term or long-term contact, it will all depend upon your choice. Those who signed a fixed rate will pay for the same price during the entire duration of the contract. In case the price of the water or energy went down, your monthly rate will not be affected.

These are just three of the factors that you need to consider when looking for the best <strong>utility service provider.</strong> Depending upon your choice, you will find the moving transition will be ultra smooth if you choose the most suitable for your situation.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/finding-the-best-utility-service-provider-when-moving/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/network-operator-3367207_960_720-jpg.jpeg,network-operator-3367207_960_720-jpg,,,network-operator-3367207_960_720.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,finding-the-best-utility-service-provider-when-moving,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020

However, for those who are <strong>moving oversized furniture</strong> on their own, we will provide you some essential tips that will make your job a lot easier. This will enable you to complete this complex and time-consuming work in an efficient and quick manner. Let us start enumerating those tips.

Measuring the Furniture

Start by removing all the parts that can be detached on your furniture. Properly label all the detached parts. The screws and other small parts will need to be placed in a zip lock bag before you <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Organizing-Your-Moving-Boxes""><strong>place it inside the moving box</strong></a>. Measure the width, length, and height of the furniture. When measuring the height of the couch, use the measurement of its highest part.

Measuring the Doorways

Once you determine the dimension of your furniture, it is time for you to measure the different doorways that you need to pass through when <strong><em>moving oversized furniture</em></strong>. Measure the width and the height of all the doorways. If you live in an apartment complex and you will have to use the elevator, you should also take measurements of its dimension. There are instances that the furniture will not fit. You will probably have to remove the door in order for the <strong>furniture to move</strong> across.

Ask Your Friends

You should never <strong>move heavy furniture</strong> on your own. Ask the help of your friends to deal with heavy items. Normally, your friends will not be excited about the idea of helping you lift these large items. However, they will still have no option but to help you since they love you. You can show your appreciation towards their effort by preparing a few bottles of beer and a box of pizza. It would be impossible to tackle this cumbersome task without the assistance of your friends.

Finally, you will have to wrap it before you <strong>move heavy furniture</strong>. This will minimize the possible damage that the furniture can acquire. You can use your blanket to cover large household items. All the scratches and nicks will make your things look unsightly so it is best to avoid them at all costs.

Land Transportation

There are different kinds of transporters that can be used in <strong><em>moving luxury cars</em></strong>. For instance, if you don’t plan to load the vehicle inside the moving truck, you may choose from multi-level auto carrier, non-stacking trailer, pickup truck, or the open or enclosed trailer.

Ocean or Air Freight

The fastest type of luxury <strong>car moving</strong> is through air. While it may be more expensive when compared to the other shipping options, there are exclusive benefits on this service that may appeal to you.

<strong>Shipping</strong> through Container

In case you are <strong>moving luxury cars</strong> through a secured container, it can be loaded at your home or at the port together with your other household items. On the off chance that you are shipping it with furniture pieces, it is recommended to create a protective layer in the container. Most of the time, the professional movers would be willing to handle this task for you. Disconnect the battery of the car and the alarm system. Fuels should also be completely drained to minimize the hazard and make it suitable for shipping.

Your car is one of the biggest investments that you will make in your lifetime. You need to make sure that it is protected when you are shipping it to another state or country. While dealing with <strong>car moving companies</strong> may be a good option, you still have to make sure that you are getting your money’s worth.

Don’t Pay Too Much

The <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/How-Much-Will-it-Cost-to-Move-Car-Overseas""><strong>rate of <em>moving your car</em></strong></a> will differ. It actually depends on the company that is offering this service. In addition, the charging can also be different contingent upon the type of special service that you require. Before signing the agreement, make sure that you will be clear about how much the company will be charging you. Ask them about the items that are included in the cost that they provide to you. Make sure that there are no <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/The-Hidden-Moving-Expenses""><strong>hidden costs</strong></a>. This will make it easier for you to compare different <strong>moving companies.</strong>

Gather Information about the Company

All <strong><em>car moving companies</em></strong> are required to be registered at the DOT (Department of transportation) office. In the event that they are offering an <strong>interstate moving</strong>, they will need to be registered at the FMCSA. These are government agencies that are responsible in providing the companies with their registration number. Once you ask the company about their registration number, they should be willing to do so. You may use their registration number to find out essential information about them. You should never do business with a company that refused to share their registration number. You should also avoid relying on verbal agreements only.

Incorrect and Missing Documents

When you are <strong>moving your car</strong>, the company will ask you to present the <strong>necessary documents</strong> before they will verify your request. Some of the common documents that they will need to include the vehicle registration and proof of insurance. You should also provide them with a proof of ownership or any evidence that you are allowed to ship the car. Prepare all these documents in advance in order to avoid any hassles.

Finally, you should not forget to remove all your personal items inside before <strong>moving your car</strong>. Although there are moving companies that will allow you to add personal items within specified limitations, the company will not be responsible in case the items were damaged. Furthermore, the extra weight will just increase your overall expenses.

In case you are moving, renting a moving truck that will help you take your personal belongings into your next <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Popular-Destination-for--Relocation""><strong>moving destination</strong></a> seems to be the more affordable option. However, this is not instantly the case. To make sure that you are getting the best deal, you need to <strong>calculate moving expenses</strong> with regards to the fuel.

Filling Up

Before <strong><em>calculating moving expenses</em></strong> related with the mileage, you will have to be aware of the average cost of the gas. There are various sizes of trucks available and their fuel consumption will differ. There are specific types of information that you can gather at the official site of the rental company. Normally, the average 10-foot to 16-foot vans will consume the regular gas while the large ones will most possibly use diesel. Usually, diesel will cost more than the regular fuels.

Distance and MPG

After that, you will have to determine the size of the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/How-to-Determine-the-Right-Moving-Truck-to-Rent""><strong>truck that you are planning to rent</strong></a> when you want to <strong><em>calculate moving expenses</em></strong> in relation to fuels. You should know that the moving truck is not the best vehicle when we are talking about fuel efficiency. Here are some of the things you need to know.
<ul>
 	<li>Small-sized truck- the average fuel consumption will be around 8-10miles/gallon</li>
 	<li>Medium-size truck- These are the trucks measuring 15-19ft. Gas consumption will be at 6-8miles/gallon.</li>
 	<li>Larger Trucks- this will consume one gallon for every 4-6 miles.</li>
</ul>
You need to determine the distance between your point of origin to your point of destination. You may use Google maps to measure the accurate destination. You should also take into account the stops that you will make and the overall weight of your load.

Higher Math

When you have prepared all the essential numbers, <strong>calculating moving expenses</strong> will be easy. Simply divide the total number of miles to the average MPG of your <strong>moving truck</strong>. For instance, if you are travelling in 600 miles using a large truck, you will get 150 which is the gallon of fuel that you will probably need. The gallons will then be multiplied to the average cost of gas per gallon.

Remember that the <strong>moving company</strong> will require you to return the moving truck to them in full tank. Make sure that you will also consider that when <strong>calculating moving expenses</strong>. In case doing the math seems to be too complicated, you can simply ask the rental company to provide you an insight regarding this matter.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/calculating-moving-expenses-for-gas/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/expenses-jpg-1.jpeg,expenses-jpg,,,expenses.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips>Moving Expense Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,calculating-moving-expenses-for-gas,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020

customer expectation| geralt|pixabay

The <strong>moving companies management</strong> should understand that managing the client expectations will start from the first time that they inquire about your service. Once the customer asks you for an estimate, the estimate will most probably be given through phone. If you don’t provide the right information, they will immediately think that the cost will be closely similar to the quote that you provide to them. Inform them that their expenses may increase or decrease according to different factors. You should go into the smallest details such as their inventory, if there are stairs, additional service that they need, and others.

Providing the Breakdown of Price

Different clients will have diverse expectations when hiring <strong><em>moving companies</em></strong>. You will need to explain to them the items that are included and not included on the price quote. This is an excellent way to avoid frustration and confusion. This will lessen the stress that the customers are feeling. The standard things that are included in the price, such as tape, moving blankets, labor, and van should be explained to the customers. You should also familiarize them about the additional services that can increase their moving expenses. All these are essentials prior to their <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Guide-to-Ensure-That-the-Cost-Will-Not-Change-During-the-Moving-Day""><strong>moving day.</strong></a>

Educate Your Customers

The <strong><em>moving companies management</em></strong> should let the clients be aware that there are things that they will need to take care personally. All these things need to be prepared before the movers knocked on their door. For instance, they will need to remove all the items inside their drawers and appliances need to be unplugged.

Checklist| Animated Heaven| Flickr

Most of the items that are included in the <strong>visual home inspections </strong>checklist should be covered by the inspector. This will include the aesthetic feature of the house. It is your responsibility as a buyer to be educated on the matters surrounding the in-house inspection.

Cooling and Heating System

Depending on the current season, you are probably unsure if the cooling and the heating system of the property are functioning optimally. By adding this on your <strong><em>moving checklist</em></strong>, you will not forget to assess their condition. Listen and determine if they are creating loud noises. Make sure that it will not release a funny smell. You can use a thermostat to gauge if the system is working properly. Be certain that all areas in the house are receiving the right amount of air circulation. The system should also immediately shutdown once the desired temperature has been reached.

Electrical

During <strong>visual home inspections</strong>, the condition of the electrical will need to be analyzed by the inspector. Start with the lighting system of your house and check if they are functioning as expected. If there are lights that are not releasing an ample amount of brightness, it may be time to replace them. You should not forget to verify the state of the circuit board. There are instances that the condition is enough to pass the inspection but it does not necessarily mean that it will be reliable. Talk to the previous owner of the house and ask them if there are any electrical issues that they are experiencing in the past.

Plumbing

The plumbing system may not always be in the <strong>moving checklist</strong> of the previous tenant. Look at your sink and identify if there are any leaks or drips below the sink while it is in the on or off mode. The drains should not be releasing a strange odor. Allow the water to run for a few minutes in order to guarantee that the house is equipped with a proper drainage system. Look at your toilet, flush and refill them repeatedly. Observe if there are any water leaking.

You should also not forget your kitchen on your <strong>moving checklist</strong> for visual home inspection. The counter should not have a noticeable dents and scratches and there should not be any signs of rotting. Inspect the hardware and the hinges of the cupboard. Open and close the drawers several times any identify if they are sliding smoothly. You should also take a look for any signs of water damage in the kitchen.

1162,What Are the Importance of ICC MC,"In an industry that has been plagued by <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Hiring-State-to-State-Movers-without-Getting-Scammed""><strong>scammers and sham movers</strong></a>, it seems that almost anyone can start their business and call themselves as moving company. However, aside from looking for their information at Yelp, there are various ways on how you can determine the eligibility of their business. One of the most effective ways is through the ICC MC of the company. In this article, we will not only discuss the meaning of that number, we will also tell you why this should be used to determine the credential of the company as well as the <strong>importance of ICC MC</strong>.

What Is It and What Are the <strong>Importance of ICC MC</strong>

<img class=""wp-image-1163"" src=""https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/639488-k-kny81-049-jpg.jpeg"" alt=""639488-K-KNY81-049.jpg"" />

moving truck| Marc Barnes| defense.gov

ICC MC (Interstate Commerce Commission of Motor Carrier) is an organization that is responsible for identifying and providing credentials to the freight truckers that are crossing the state lines. This will include the professional movers. The primary function of the agency is to guarantee that the fair rates and tariffs are being enforced by the company. They are also in control of the industry and would constantly monitor the actions of the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Intrastate-vs.-Interstate-Moving-Companies""><strong>moving companies</strong></a>. They will also collect the necessary information on the long-distance movers to ensure that the industry will provide a better service for the people.

However, that responsibility has been transferred to the FMCSA (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration) last 1996. This agency belongs to the office of the DOT (Department of Transportation). The movers today are now required to carry a DOT number. This number should be displayed on the vehicle of the company. Nevertheless, the more established movers will have an ICC MC displayed on their trailers or cabs; this one <strong><em>importance of ICC MC</em></strong>. This shows that the moving company has all the rights to deliver their interstate <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Where-to-Find-Discounts-for-the-Moving-Services""><strong>moving service </strong></a>within the specific guidelines under various operation requirements, geographical areas, and cargo types.

Why Is It Useful?

Just like the different credentialing framework of the federal system, having an ICC MC number simply means that the movers has been certified by the agency that regulates and monitors the industry. This will help you stay away from doing business with a substandard company. Knowing that you are working with <strong><em>moving companies</em></strong> that have credentials and have been authorized by the agency will calm your nerves since you know that they will operate in compliance with the standard regulations of the industry. So in case you are planning to hire the service of the movers, be sure to ask them if they have this number on their files.

There are differences between the DOT and ICC MC Number. The latter is particularly focused on the economic standard of the industry while DOT is monitoring the compliance of the company on the safety and records. Today, DOT number is only being used as an identification which is more reason why a person should look for the <strong>importance of ICC MC</strong>.

payment| Max Pixel

The amount that you need to <strong>pay the movers to pack</strong> and move will depend upon the number of items that need to be transported, the distance that they will need to cover and the extra services that you requested. Asking added services will translate to increased charges. In case you want to save money, you will need to find ways to reduce the time needed to complete the job.

<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/How-to-Make-the-Local-Move-Less-Complicated""><strong>Local Move</strong></a>

Hiring the standard movers will charge you $90-$120 <strong><em>movers per hour</em></strong>. The cost will be contingent upon the place where you live, the time and other extra consideration. The movers that are offering specialty services such as transporting art pieces, or packing jewelry will obviously cost much higher. In case you wanted to pay only for the labor and you have your own pickup truck, prepare to shell out around $60-$80 per hour. Remember that these hourly rate will depend upon the services that are associated with it. The rates will also differ for those who live in the countryside and the major cities.

Size of the house will also help you determine the amount you need to <strong><em>pay the movers to pack</em></strong> and move. By using the lowest mark which is $25/hour, you would be able to complete the basic computation. For the standard type of studio apartment it will take around 3-4 hours to complete the task. Without any anticipated complications, you need to prepare at least $150-$200. Moving a house that is bigger with a garage that is filled with so many stuff will obviously cost more.

Interstate move or move that allows you to cross the state’s borderline and the moves that are beyond 100miles are called long distance move. This means that the money that you need to pay <strong>movers per hour</strong> will be more costly. When you find yourself in this situation, you are probably wondering if it would be better to ask for a flat rate or choose the hourly rate. In a state-to-state move, the company will normally calculate the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Estimated-Local-Moving-Costs""><strong>moving cost </strong></a>according to the weight of the entire shipment. The average cost will be $0.70/lb. The charges will also rely upon the mileage and added services.

It is highly likely that you have outgrown your office and you will need an additional space in order to accommodate the other tasks that come with it.

You Want to Increase Your Profit

In case your home business requires you to meet with your client personally, having an outside office would be recommended. This conveys the message to your prospective client that you are professional and that you are serious with your business. It could increase your lead generation and your profit if you <strong><em>move your home</em></strong> office. A proper office space will give your clients a sense of privacy and security. You will never have to worry about your spouse, kids, or pets that will interrupt your meeting. Any interruption can pre-empt the signing of the contract. If you are providing a service to your client, having an office at the commercial center of the city will make it easier for the potential client to look for you.

You Need To Hire Workers

Most business owners will relay a story about their start-up days when their one worker will need to work inside their living room. However, there will come a time that you will have to <strong>move your office </strong>to a rental facility. This will make it easier for you to attract talents. You will also have enough space to accommodate your employees. Be sure that before you move, you already have a clear idea on how many employees you need to hire. This will enable you to choose an office space that is enough for the entire team.

Decreasing Productivity

For those who are operating in the comfort of their home, they will soon realize that it is quite difficult to focus on their work since there are too many distractions in their house. Multi-tasking will be tempting but it can adversely affect your productivity. You will definitely benefit more when you choose to <strong>move your home</strong> office to a real office in the business area.

This is also a chance for you to explore the different facets of the new community. Take this opportunity to determine the distance between your house and the new office. In case you are planning to take your family with you, you need to know the performance of the school, the quality of health services, safety, and other factors that can affect their lives.

Temporary Living Arrangement

In the event that your company is asking you to relocate in a restricted amount of time, you should ask them to provide you a temporary housing arrangement. This will be until such time that you will find a more suitable and permanent home. This is an excellent chance for you to get 1-2 months of free rent and save enough money for the deposit or for the upfront payment of a new house. This will also be helpful in case you were not able to sell your previous home before <strong><em>job relocation</em></strong>.

Packing and Transporting Your Household and Office Items

In case the company is providing you with a moving package, you will need to carefully read all the details. This will allow you to negotiate for things that are not mentioned in the package. For instance, if the company is covering the transportation of your household items, you may ask them to shoulder the cost of packing your items. Are they also willing to cover the specialized part of your relocation such as your piano, large furniture, refrigerator and others when <strong>moving for a job</strong>?

Finally, you can also negotiate the storage, the expenses for unforeseen situations, and other reimbursement that are related in the process of <strong>moving for a job</strong>. After you know the elements that you can negotiate with your employer, make sure that you will hire the assistance of the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Toss-These-Items-First-Before-Calling-the-Professional-Mover""><strong>professional movers</strong></a> who will help you deal with the intricate process of relocation.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/things-to-negotiate-when-moving-for-a-job/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14762294119_e96617df09_b-jpg.jpeg,14762294119_e96617df09_b-jpg,,,14762294119_e96617df09_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips>Moving Option,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,things-to-negotiate-when-moving-for-a-job,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020
1183,"Which is the Better Option, PODS or Storage Unit?","There are instances that transporting your items will be more challenging than packing up your things. Perhaps you are downsizing and you want to purge your unnecessary items.

When the time comes that you need to move, you will have two major <strong>storage solutions</strong> to choose from, PODS and storage unit. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages that you need to look into when choosing the best option for your situation.

PODS

PODS are large metal containers that are portable and will be delivered right into your home. Once the PODS have been dropped in your location, you may either hire the service of the professionals or load you items yourself. This will then be storage into their facility, delivered to your new location, or stored into your previous home. When choosing between <strong><em>PODS or storage unit</em></strong>, the PODS are durable and they have the ability to resist harsh weather elements. They are also intended for long-term storage that can also function as moving container.

Having PODS as your <strong><em>storage solutions</em></strong> means that you can complete the loading task at your preferred pace and time. You don’t have to be stressed about it. Since this container is on ground-level, you can easily accomplish the task on your own. On the other hand, this is also not designed as an all-in-one solution. Since this will be transported to your location, you should have enough space that will accommodate the size of the container. This may not be possible for those who live in a busy street. There are also city regulations and ordinances that are likely restricting the use of PODS.

Self Storage

When we think about moving to another place, self-storage is what we normally consider when we have to temporarily store our other items. You can access and remove the items in this unit whenever you feel like doing so. Whether you choose <strong>PODS or storage unit</strong>, expect that they will be following a particular opening hours that will only enable you to access the unit in a specific time. Storage units are undoubtedly more cost-efficient when compared to PODS. The disadvantage in using this option is that you are required to take your items directly to the facility. There is also the hassles that come with the loading and unloading your stuff.

For those who are looking for a temporary solution, the storage unit would be the best choice. On the contrary, those who require flexibility will realize that PODS has the advantage. In case you are still undecided, your professional <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Things-to-Look-for-on-Moving-Company-Sales-Leads""><strong>moving company</strong></a> can provide you with recommendations that will help you choose between <strong>PODS or storage unit</strong>.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/which-is-the-better-option-pods-or-storage-unit/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4713508983_6015fac152_b-jpg.jpeg,4713508983_6015fac152_b-jpg,,,4713508983_6015fac152_b.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,which-is-the-better-option-pods-or-storage-unit,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020

With regards to your financial management, <strong>preparing to move into your first apartment</strong> can be filled with logistic challenges. Fortunately, there are money-saving tips that you can use that will ensure you that you can manage your finance pool better.

Design a Housing Budget and Stick to It

In case you are hunting for an apartment, it is relatively easy for you to be tempted to a nice place that is located near the city. While this may make things more convenient for you when going to the different establishments, it may not fit within your preferred budget. You need to remind yourself that if you choose to go over your housing budget, the excess cash will have to be taken from your other expenses. You should be picky when <strong><em>moving to your first apartment</em></strong>. Sign the agreement once you are sure that you can comfortably afford the rental cost.

Create a Budget for Everything

When you are <strong><em>preparing to move into your first apartment,</em></strong> it is only expected that you will plan for everything. This should include the budget for all your expenses. After knowing the preferred budget for your monthly rental expenses, you need to remember the 50-30-20 rules. This means that 50% of your current income should be allotted to the monthly expenses with fixed rate such as car payment, groceries, utilities and your rent. 30% should be added into your savings and 20% can be used for leisurely activities.

Be Creative

Filling-up your new space with new furniture pieces is not a smart thing to do; this will only use up your entire budget. Ask your friend to accompany you on thrift stores, consignment shops, and yard sale to find a more affordable option. Craigslist would also be an excellent place to look for items that you need when <strong>moving into your first apartment</strong>. Before going to yard sale, be sure that you will have a checklist of the items that you will need to avoid purchasing unnecessary items. If you really want to save money, start with only a minimal amount of items in you new house.

There are various ways on how you can save money before <strong>moving to your first apartment</strong>. Another sure way to save cash is to ask for the moving quote from a reputable <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Things-to-Know-When-Hiring-a-Moving-Company-for-the-First-Time""><strong>moving company</strong></a>.

Blended families will have to go through significant changes and adjustments. While there are many things that you should celebrate, it is still essential to be prepared for the onslaught of challenges that await you. Before taking a relationship into new heights, here are some <strong>things to consider when blending a family</strong>.

Never Forget Your Relationship

It is relatively easy for us to be caught up in the details that come with the transition process. However, you should not forget to devote enough time for your loved ones. You should be genuine and intentional in inviting your partner in creating an alone time. It should be a time without any distraction and away from your kids. It can be as easy as staying away from all the gadgets at least an hour before you go to sleep. Keeping a healthy relationship will help you ensure that your <strong><em>blended family</em></strong> will remain happy.

Make Time for the Families

When you are making the transition, especially if you have children, you will understand that it will be a challenging process. There are times that it will lead to jealousy. It is your responsibility to soothe and support the emotions of the members of the family by setting a time exclusive for them. One of the <strong><em>things to consider when blending a family</em></strong> is to keep on doing the things that you used to do when you are not yet blended. If there are usual family activities that you are doing such as Sunday Brunch or Movie nights, keep on doing those things. Nothing should change just because you are going through a transition.

Make the Kids Feel Involved

You need to assist your kids when creating a sense of contribution and connection by making them involved in the process. It can be as simple as <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Guide-on-Packing-during-Your-Move""><strong>packing during the move</strong></a>, or picking their preferred color for their room.

Although the property manager and landlord will primarily be responsible to guarantee the comfort and habitability of the rental property, they are not liable to the damages that are caused by the tenant. There are also various <strong>tenants responsibilities</strong> that you have to remember to maintain a cordial relationship with your landlord.

Paying Rent on Time

Most of the rental or lease agreement will explain the date that you need to settle your payment. It will also highlight the ‘late fees’ in the event that you were not able to pay the rent on time. This is the best way to remain friendly with the landlord. This can also ensure that you will be out of trouble. Most of the banks can assist you in setting up an automatic payment system so you won’t forget anything. They will be sending a check to your landlord on your behalf so you can proceed to your normal life. In case you are having trouble in memorizing the details and dates, be sure that you will consider this plan to remind yourself on the <strong><em>responsibilities of tenants.</em></strong>

Taking Care of Particular Repairs

As we mentioned above, there are some repairs that the landlords are not accountable of. The minor repairs such as the clogged sink, light bulbs, and noisy doors should be <strong><em>tenants responsibilities</em></strong>. Buying the basic household items that can help you deal with that situation such as sink cleaner will be greatly appreciated by the landlord. The major issues will not be your responsibility as long as it is not your fault. In case you accidentally broke the window, you should inform your landlord first since they may prefer a particular service company. After all the repairs have been completed, expect that you will be the one to pay the damages.

Keeping Your Space Clean

One of the <strong>responsibilities of the tenants</strong> is the cleanliness of the space. It does not necessarily mean that it has to be spotless. At the very least, it should be free from any garbage. All trash should be disposed in an appropriate manner. Keeping the space clean will also help you avoid damage and pest infestation.

Finally, you should also show some respect to your neighbors. The <strong>responsibilities of tenants</strong> will not just be limited on the area around the properties that you are renting but it also includes the community. Avoid having late night parties and maintain the noise level to a minimum. Observe the proper community guidelines and you will not find yourself in trouble <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Things-You-Learn-After-Moving-Out""><strong>after moving</strong></a>.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/responsibilities-of-tenants-that-you-need-to-be-aware-of/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/apartment-743379_960_720-jpg.jpeg,apartment-743379_960_720-jpg,,,apartment-743379_960_720.jpg,,,Guides>Moving Guide,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,responsibilities-of-tenants-that-you-need-to-be-aware-of,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020

Before you begin adding your property on the market list, it is essential that you have a basic understanding of your <strong>landlords responsibilities</strong>. You should also be well versed on the obligations to have a legal and ethical business situation.

Provide Your Tenants with Receipts and Copy of the Lease Agreement

This is one of the basic <strong><em>responsibilities of the landlord</em></strong>. Most tenants want to maintain a comprehensive records and documents of anything related with the rental property. This may include the date that the monthly rental fee was paid and in what kind or form. All receipts should be given to the tenants without any charges. Additionally, it is also recommended to record them since you might find it handy in the future. You should also provide them with a copy of the agreement. This will allow the tenant to understand the terms, for instance the legal repercussions should they decide to break the lease agreement.

Provide Immediate Assistance to Repairs

The <strong><em>landlords responsibilities</em></strong> is also related to the condition of the property. They need to make sure that their property will remain ‘habitable’. If anyone was injured due to the part of your property that needs repair, you can end up in a huge legal mess. In case you don’t live near your rental property, you should have a property manager who will take care of the situation. A 24-hour notice should be provided by the tenant before the repairs will proceed. This is normally the case except during a life-threatening situation.

Renter’s Insurance

You may not be required to do this but we still consider this as one of the <strong>responsibilities of the landlord</strong>. They should recommend insurance to their tenants to guarantee that your property will be covered during unforeseen situations. On the off chance that they don’t want to enroll, it is advisable that you always carry an ample amount of coverage. Your current insurance provider will be willing to provide you extra renter policy for a very affordable cost.

It is also the <strong>responsibility of the landlord</strong> to keep the rental property neat and clean. The lease agreement will specify the person who will be accountable for the snow removal, yard work, and other pertinent tasks. Garbage should be properly disposed of, and the rental space should preserve the wellbeing of the tenant. All these responsibilities will allow you to operate your business legally.

Planning the Move

Packing Efficiently

This means that the drawers should already be emptied and all the essentials have already been packed. This will enable the movers to work immediately without waiting for you to complete the task. The moving tasks should be spread out on several weeks to avoid crunching.

Stay Cool

It can be relatively easy to forget to drink water and relax when we are dealing with all the tasks and stress of moving. Ensure that the air conditioning unit is functioning properly and the house is properly cooled down before the professional movers knock on your door.

On the off chance that you are managing three companies that are offering the same <strong>moving company quotes</strong>, there are some basics on computing the varying prices. This will help you determine the company that you are looking for.

Guaranteed

The terms that the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Tips-on-Hiring-a-Credible-Moving-Company""><strong>moving company</strong></a> will use to describe their quote will vary especially for the <strong><em>hourly moving company</em></strong>. However, if you are dealing with the fixed or guaranteed rate, this means that unless there are things that will change on the details, the price will remain unchanged.

For those who are inquiring the quote from the moving company, this is the formula that they will commonly use. This will eliminate the unnecessary risks on all parties and will promote transparency.

Non-Binding

Compared to the binding estimate, this type of <strong><em>moving company quotes</em></strong> will not be guaranteed. Sometimes it will be presented as a flat rate to the potential customers. This price can be altered based on the discretion of the movers. The non-binding estimate is often the source of misunderstanding between the customers and the company. While this may appear to be cheaper compared to the other pricing structure, it is essential to understand that you can’t use this for price comparison. This is misleading since the cost can be changed without notifying the customers. You should remain cautious when receiving a non-binding estimate.

Hourly Rate

The cost of <strong>hourly moving company</strong> is determined by the length of hours that the movers will need to complete the task. This is not directly related with the weight and cubic feet of the items that you will ship. Compared to the non-binding estimate, the cost of per hour rate is more predictable.

The Items to Take With You

The moving tasks may not be in your list of the things that you are excited about. However, with the right amount of planning and looking at the <strong>things to consider when moving</strong>, the process will be less stressful and bearable. Here are some of our professional recommendations that will guarantee a more convenient move.

Purge Your Items

Before you learn how to plan your <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Move-in-Advance:-How-Long-Do-You-Need-to-Schedule-Your-Moving-Day?""><strong>moving day</strong></a>, you will have to go through all your household items. In case it’s been a while since the last time you moved, there is a high possibility that you’ve accumulated a range of items. Some of them may be lying dormant in your storage room or basement. Moving presents the best opportunity to discard items that are just taking space. Prepare at least three boxes; one for the item that you plant to donate, those items that you should sell, and the items that should already be discarded.

Research

Before you move to a new city, you should be familiar with the different things related to the city. The information related with the city is one of the <strong><em>things to consider when moving</em></strong>. Make sure that the city will offer you things that will make your life comfortable. Think about the features that you want to have in your old community. The city should also complement your lifestyle. If you love outdoor adventures, the city should have different opportunities for outdoor recreational activities.

Organizing All Documents and Records

If you want to know <strong>how to plan your moving day </strong>efficiently, you should never ignore the records and documents. Obtaining a copy of these documents will be time-consuming. To ensure that you will not forget them, arrange all the documents into a single file folder or binder. All receipts should also be added in this binder. Some of the records that you need to take with you include the medical records, school transcripts, birth certificate, veterinary records, and others.

Label the Moving Boxes

Adding the proper label on your moving boxes is one of the important<a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Things-You-Should-Consider-When-Moving-to-the-Beach""> <strong>things to consider when moving</strong></a>. You can use a color-coding system for the different rooms. You can also label them using the numbering system which will indicate the importance of the items inside. For instance, you can add the tag ‘Bedroom 1’ which shows that this contains all the essential items in your bedroom.

Finally, you should also plan for a delicious meal at the end of your moving day. This is a reward for yourself after learning <strong>how to plan your moving day</strong> conveniently.

In case you think that you have to <strong>move to a new place</strong> but you are still hesitating, this article is intended for you. We have listed some of the signs that will help you determine that it is the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Time-to-Move-Out-of-Your-Parents-House""><strong>best time for you to relocate</strong></a>. Here are some of them.

You Can’t Afford to Stay in Your Current Location

Money is definitely one of the biggest reasons why people need to <strong><em>move to a new city</em></strong>. In case your inability to manage your finances is putting pressure and stress on you, and it appears like you can’t live comfortably in your current community, then it is the perfect time for you to look for a more affordable city. If the cost of living to the city has prevented you from enjoying your life, then there is just no point in staying in that city. <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Guide-on-Finding-the-Most-Affordable-Places-to-Live""><strong>Relocate to a more affordable community</strong> </a>where you can grab a drink with your friends anytime you like.

Achieving Your Goal

Your passion and your dreams have been ignored for a very long time now. Your life is not necessarily a mess but your daily life is too redundant and predictable. Those who <strong><em>move to a new place</em></strong> can open themselves to new opportunities and changes that they need. Achieving your goals and dreams is one of the main reasons why people move. It is the perfect time for you to transform all your dreams into a reality.

Stresses about the Weather

The weather of the city is affecting your lifestyle. Everything is just too much, whether it is windy, cold, hot, or wet. Some people may think that the weather may not be a valid reason to <strong>move to a new city</strong>. However, the weather has a direct effect on your overall happiness and health. In case you’ve had enough of the daily weather forecast of the city, then pack your bags and <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Best-Places-to-Move-for-the-Expats""><strong>move to a place</strong></a> with mild climate.

Bad Memories

While you are living in your current community, you can’t help but relieve all those bad and awful memories. Every place in this area will remind you about that uneventful day that you want to forget. Once you <strong>move to a new place</strong>, you will have a fresh perspective. You no longer have to avoid a certain establishment that will remind you about a sad memory.

Finally, if there are no reasons for you to stay and living in your current community seems meaningless, then it is time to <strong>move to a new city</strong>. When you can’t find the answer to the question ‘why do you choose to live here?’, then it is a clear sign that you need to start packing your household items and move.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/signs-that-its-the-perfect-time-to-move-to-a-new-city/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/movers-24402_960_720-png.png,movers-24402_960_720-png,,,movers-24402_960_720.png,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,signs-that-its-the-perfect-time-to-move-to-a-new-city,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020
1241,Breaking Your Lease Guide,"Although you have never been late in settling your monthly rental fee, the lease agreement clearly states that you will have to cover the specific rental period or term. This means that if you failed to abide in the agreement and terminate it 5 months ahead of time, there is a possibility that you will end up owing your landlord 5 times more than your monthly rental cost. <strong>Breaking your lease </strong>can also end up in a higher cost due to the numerous fees involved.

For those who want to know <strong>how to break lease</strong>, you need to understand that it will be easy. However, paying the fines and the fees that come with it will not necessarily be simple. In this article, we will discuss some of the possible ways on how you and your landlord can reach an amicable settlement.

Notify Them in Advance

In case you have no plans to renew the lease agreement, you will have to notify your landlord at least 30 days ahead of time before you terminate the contract. Just to make sure, you should check the agreement particularly the clause that pertains to <strong><em>breaking your lease</em></strong>. In some situations, you will have to inform the landlords or property managers 90 days in advance. Your intention to vacate the property should be provided in written form. Make sure that you will indicate all the important details in your letter.

Be Aware of the Law

The federal, states, and even the local government have enacted laws that are protecting landlords and the tenant. These laws will differ <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/The-Best-Place-to-Live-Depending-on-your-Lifestyle""><strong>depending on the place that you live</strong></a>. When learning <strong>how to break lease</strong>, it is essential that you familiarize yourself with the existing laws. For instance, the Federal law is protecting tenants who are in the military service. There are also others that protect the renters on a varying condition. There are laws which specify that the landlord should make a decent effort in looking for a replacement for your rental apartment. This is regardless of the reason for breaking the agreement. Try to consult an expert that will educate you about the legal matters.

You Should Remain Open to Solutions and Be Prepared to Settle the Payment

In case the reason behind <strong>breaking your lease</strong> is not covered or protected under the law, you should read your lease agreement and understand how much this decision will cost. Usually, you will have to cover the remaining monthly period cost as well as the steep fines. There is also a possibility that your landlord will not return your deposit. Talk to your landlord about the possible solution that you can reach. Remember that terminating the agreement will not only place a financial strain on the part of the tenant but also on the landlord.

Finally, you will have to keep everything documented on <strong>breaking your lease</strong> and seek the legal service if necessary. After you reach a favorable solution with your property manager and it is <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Time-to-Move-To-a-Bigger-House""><strong>time for you to move</strong></a>, call the assistance of the expert movers to help you in moving.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/breaking-your-lease-guide/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/contract-1464917_960_720-jpg.jpeg,contract-1464917_960_720-jpg,,,contract-1464917_960_720.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,breaking-your-lease-guide,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020

The reasons of the customer behind their urgency to <strong>cancel moving help</strong> may vary. As movers, you will need to make the clients realized that they are investing their hard-earned money to the right company. This will minimize the probability that they will have to cancel their bookings. Here are the best methods to use to stay away from cancellations.

Communicating Regularly

You will have to confirm the booking of the customers around 24 hours after they called your <strong><em>moving companies</em></strong>. This will ease their worries and let them know that you have the same understanding about their <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Move-in-Advance:-How-Long-Do-You-Need-to-Schedule-Your-Moving-Day?""><strong>moving schedule</strong></a>. After this confirmation, you should also give them periodic phone calls that will increase their satisfaction and engagement rate. Moving is a process filled with anxiety and stress and it is your responsibility to quell their worries. You can provide them some essential tips that will make the process a little less daunting. This will greatly reduce the rate of cancellation.

During the phone call, remind them on how your company can make the whole moving process easier. You should also inform them about the extra services that you can offer that will keep their items safe. When sending them email messages, avoid using automated and robotic emails, make it more personalized. Remind yourself that there is a possibility that they are talking with the other companies so you should not give them a reason to <strong><em>cancel moving help</em></strong>.

Final Confirmation

Around 2-3 days before the scheduled <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/What-to-Expect-on-Moving-Day""><strong>moving day</strong></a>, <strong>moving companies</strong> should call them for a final confirmation. This is a perfect opportunity for both parties to update each other about the changes that possibly occurred. Talk to them about the moving plan once again and confirm the whole process. Remind them about the supplies, services, and equipment that they requested. Walk them through the whole process in detail. Ask if there are things that they don’t understand or if you missed some details.

Finally, in case cancellation is inevitable, this does not necessarily mean that you have to forget about them. There is a possibility that they are just postponing their move or they are looking for specialized <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/What-Does-the-Full-Moving-Services-Include""><strong>service from moving companies</strong></a>. Providing them with the attention they need will maintain them as your customer.

When <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Setting-Up-Utilities-for-a-New-House-Before-Moving""><strong>moving to a new house</strong></a>, it is essential to decorate the place based on your own preference and in a way that will remind you of your old home. This will make the transition process less-stressful and bearable. Nonetheless, it is still necessary for you to maintain the safety, durability and freshness of your space that will make it suitable for your house pet. You and your pets will feel at ease once you follow some of the tips below.

Look for Durable Flooring Materials

It is not recommended to choose a costly carpet and softwood materials regardless of how aesthetically pleasing they look. The quality of these materials will be adversely affected once you have an active pet running around your home. The softwoods can be covered with scratch marks and your carpet will be filled with furs. When creating <strong><em>pet-friendly home designs</em></strong>, it is advisable to choose ceramic tiles on the areas that receive high level of traffic. When you opt for hardwoods, remember that the large dogs can leave scratches on these materials, so it is advisable to use this on your master bedroom.

Purchase Durable Furniture

Whether you are allowing your dog on your furniture pieces or not, their tiny hairs have a way to get through them. Look for the type of upholstery that has a strong resistance against staining and make sure that it is easy to maintain and clean. For the cushions on the couch, the covers should be removable that allows you to clean them easily. This is one of the most effective ways to create <strong>pet-friendly home designs</strong>. Pleather and leather couches will not necessarily be covered with their hair, but they can still sustain damage from the scratches and bites of our pets.

Create a Pet Area

For those who have cats and dogs, you will need to deal with their constant goings and comings. The debris, dirt, and the stuff they bring with them can be hard to deal with especially if you are <strong><em>moving to a new house</em></strong>. You may create a particular area where the dog can hang out. Place a mat on the floor that can trap their muddy foot before they come inside your house.

As a responsible pet owner, you are accountable for the good living conditions of your pet. When moving to a new place, it is an opportunity for you to create <strong>pet-friendly home designs </strong>that your pets will surely adore.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/creating-pet-friendly-home-designs-for-your-new-house/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/download-jpg-3.jpeg,download-jpg,,,download.jpg,,,Tips>Moving Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,creating-pet-friendly-home-designs-for-your-new-house,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/5/2020

Knowing Your Deductibles

To help the movers cultivate the right type of lead, we will enumerate the common issues that you may encounter when buying lead list. We will also present some possible solution that will create a cost-effective marketing strategy.

Purchased and Organic

The organic type of <strong><em>moving company sales lead</em></strong> would be the better option for most companies.

For instance, they probably joined your newsletter or reached out to you through your e-mail account. Those with mailing list may prefer to purchase lead list from the marketing agency. Obtaining a quality lead list will give you the ability to reach the customers who may be interested in your service. Nonetheless, this group of people may ignore your messages since you haven’t received any permission from them. Leads from the lead-generator sites are composed of individuals in the moving industry but with regards to the quality, these leads are still below standard.

Free Moving Company Leads

<strong><em>Moving company lead sources</em></strong> that will ask you to bid or pursue the lead personally, will deliver a minimum amount of result. There is absolutely no guarantee that your prospective client will return the inquiry. There is no way to verify if the lead is spam or real people. You have to look for the exclusive type of lead list that has not been offered to other moving companies. Unfortunately, it would be impossible for you to find them on this site. Your profile account will sometimes be limited unless you enroll on their premium service.

Cheap Leads

In case the <strong>moving company sales lead</strong> is offered at a discounted price, there is a possibility that it has been offered to other companies. The marketing company is reselling this in order to boost their return. The cheap lead list may also provide inaccurate and incomplete information. The possibility that it may contain error is fairly high especially if this is unauthenticated.

So what makes the <strong>moving company sales lead</strong> high quality? It should be verified for duplication, the inaccurate information should’ve been filtered out. The information of the customer should be complete which may contain their physical address, email address, and contact information. They should also provide a clear request, whether they will need a residential, office, or <a href=""https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/How-Commercial-Moving-Companies-Work""><strong>commercial move</strong></a>.

As a company that is dedicated in improving the experience of everyone involved in the moving industry, we would like to help you avoid this horrible scenario. We listed some of the <a href=""http://www.topmovingreviews.com/Move/Tips-on-Hiring-a-Credible-Moving-Company""><strong>things to consider when hiring a moving company</strong></a> and the factors that you need to avoid.

Over-the-Phone Estimates

In case the company will not give you their estimate on a written form, then it is highly unlikely that their word will be trustworthy. You should never rely on verbal agreement when doing business with a moving company. This will increase the possibility of getting <strong><em>lowball estimates</em></strong>. Written estimate should be asked in order to use it as a reference in the future. You should also make sure that they will be personally producing the invoice.

Too Good to Be True

This is one of the <strong>things to consider when hiring a moving company</strong>. If the company is providing you a ‘too-good-to-be-true’ quote, then there is a high chance that it is. You should carefully peruse the details in print to confirm the things that are included in the estimate. Normally the labor, fuels, and other things that you will assume are included in the list will usually be left out.

Company That Is Not Asking Enough Question

When you ask for an estimate of the moving company and they did not ask you important questions, then you are probably receiving <strong>lowball estimates</strong>. Some of the possible questions that should be asked by the company are related with elevators, stairs, distance, and the things that need to be moved. Their lack of information will prevent them from giving you an accurate estimate.

How to Avoid This

This matter can be avoided if you do the right research and learn the <strong>things to consider when hiring a moving company</strong>. Start by asking referrals from your trusted friends and family members. You should also not limit yourself on one moving company. Make sure that you will ask for the quote of at least 3-4 companies. Avoid companies that will provide you an estimate over the phone, if possible, ask them to perform an in-house assessment. The company will ask a representative to record all things that you will have to move.

Finally, you should ask the movers to provide you a binding quote or at the very least signed quote. Be certain that all pertinent items are included to avoid <strong>lowball estimates</strong>. The reputable movers will offer this to their client before the moving day. So in case the company refused to provide you with a signed estimate, then it may be better to seek assistance somewhere else.",,1/5/2020,post,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/avoiding-lowball-estimates-from-the-movers/,https://www.topmovingreviews.com/Moving-guides/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/estimate-jpg.jpeg,estimate-jpg,,,estimate.jpg,,,Tips->Moving Tips->Moving Expense Tips,,publish,1,admin,admin@topmovingreviews.com,,,avoiding-lowball-estimates-from-the-movers,,,0,0,0,open,open,1/6/2020
